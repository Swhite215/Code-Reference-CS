Fundamentals of Networking
    1. Basics
        a. What is a network?
            - Nothing more than two connected computers sharing resources with one another
        b. What is it composed of?
            - Physical Connection (wires, cables, wireless media)
            - Logical Connection (data transporting across physical media)
        c. SOHO
            - Small Office & Home Office Network
            - Internet -> DSL -> Wireless Firewall/Router -> Switch -> PC/Devices + Wireless
    2. Basic Networking Rules
        a. Communication Protocols
            - Computers must use same procedures for sending and receiving data
            - Date should be delivered uncorrupted
            - Computer must be capable of determining origin and destination of piece of information IP and Mac Address
    3. Why build a network?
        a. Ease and Efficiency
            - Prior to networks, information was sent and received by hand
            - Enables faster and more efficient communication
            - Encourages use of standard policies and procedures
            - Redundancy. backup and recovery support for our data

                - No centralized control over shared resources
                - Any machine can share its resources as it pleases
            - Advantages

                - Users may be forced to use many passwords
                - Each machine must be backed up individually to protect shared data
                - There is no centralized organizational scheme
