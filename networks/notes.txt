Fundamentals of Networking
    1. Basics
        a. What is a network?
            - Nothing more than two connected computers sharing resources with one another
        b. What is it composed of?
            - Physical Connection (wires, cables, wireless media)
            - Logical Connection (data transporting across physical media)

                - Users may be forced to use many passwords
                - Each machine must be backed up individually to protect shared data
                - There is no centralized organizational scheme
        c. Client-Server Architecture
            - Characteristics
                - Network is composed of clients and servers
                - Servers provide centralized control over network resources i.e. files, printers, auth, etc

                    - Built-In fault tolerance
                    - Central device is single point of failure
                - Mesh Topology
                    - Each device is connected to every other device by separate cabling
