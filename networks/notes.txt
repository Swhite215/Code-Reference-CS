    10. Computer Networking Ports
        a. Why do we need ports?
            - Network application multi-tasking
            - Ports allow you to associate packets with TCP/IP protocols
            - Network services are assigned a Port Number (DNS, HTTP, SMTP, FTP, POP3, TELNET)
            - HTTP TCP Port 80, SMTP TCP Port 25, POP3 TCP Port 110
            - Firewalls filter network traffic by port numbers
            - TCP/IP has 65,536 ports available
        b. Well Known Ports (TCP or UDP)
            - Numbers < 1024
            - FTP 20, 21
            - SSH 22
            - Telnet 23
            - SMTP 25
            - DNS 53
            - TFTP 69
            - HTTP 80
            - POP3 110
            - IMAP4 143
            - HTTPS 443
        c. Process
            - Initialzie high random port to communicate
            - Send various requests at different ports
                - IP address UDP/53 for DNS
                - Web Information TCP/80 for HTTP
                - Secure Web Information TCP/443 for HTTPS
            - Receive responses on high random port selected earlier
    11. Internet Protocol Addressing v4 (IPv4)
        a. IP Address Components
            - Network Address
            - Host Address
        b. Classes
            - A = N.H.H.H
            - B = N.N.H.H
            - C = N.N.N.H
        c. Identifying Classes
            - 0 - 127 = Class A
            - 128 - 191 = Class B
            - 192 - 223 = Class C
        d. Private Addresses
            - Non-Routable IP Address
            - Network Address Translation to route traffic from network to network
            - Used for efficiency and reusability
    12. Subnetting
        a. What is subnetting?
            - Process of breaking up Class A, B, and C networks into smaller, more manageable networks
            - We borrow host bits top create more sub-networks
            - When you borrow you increase the amount of sub-networks, aka subnets available and decrease the amount of host IP addresses available
        b. Why subnet?
            - Allows you to create multiple logical networks that exist within a single Class A, B, or C network.
    13. Network Design Process
        a. Identify Uses of the Network
            - Determing why the organization needs a network
            - Interview owners, executives, managers, operations staff, etc.
        b. List Which Tasks Execute on Which Computers
            - Which applications and tasks have to be performed on each of the computers on the network
            - You need to know how powerfl each computer should be (CPU, RAM, HD Space, Monitor Size)
        c. Select the Type of Network: Centralized or Not
            - Peer-to-Peer or Client-Server Architecture?
            - Servers Services
                - File Server, Print Server, Email Server, Application Server, Web Server, Authentication Server, Backup Server
        d. Select the Proper Equipment
            - Consider: uses, tasks, monetary constraints, reliability, security, availability, scalability
        e. Draw the Network
        f. Write the Specifications 
        g. Build It
