        - Division
        - Division Algorithm
        - Modular Arithmetic
      b. Project: 
         - Part 1: Write Multiplication of Two Numbers (31, 22) in Base 10 - Part 1
            - Convert each number to binary
            - Multiply according to Multiplication of Integers Algorithm - Algorithm 3
            - Add, according to Addition of Integers Algorithm - Algorithm 2
            - Convert product binary number back to decimal - Algorithm 1
         - Part 2: Project: Writing Project - Two Topic Research - Part 2
            - Describe some of the different algorithms for string matching
            - Explain how the complexity of parallel algorithms can be measured. 
               - Give some examples to illustrate this concept, showing how a parallel algorithm can work more quickly than on that does not operate in parallel.
