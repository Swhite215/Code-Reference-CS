Chapter 10: Graphs
    a. Graph Terminology
        - Graph - consists of vertices or nodes and edges
        - Directed Graph - consists of vertices and directed edges, each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices, start at u and end at v
        - Types
            - Simple
            - Multigraph
            - Pseudograph
            - Simple Directed
            - Directed Multigraph
            - Mixed Graph
        - Regular - if every vertx has the same degree
    b. Graph Terminology and Special Types of Graphs
        - Basic Terminology
            - Two vertices u and v in an undirected graph G are called adjacent if u and v are endpoints of an edge e. Edge e is called incident with u and v and is said to connect u and v
            - Neighborhood - N(A) all vertices in G that are adjacent to at least one vertex in A
            - Degree - degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with it, except that loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree
            - Theorem 1 (Handshaking Theorem) - sum of the degrees of the vertices of an undirected graph is even
            - Theorem 2 - an undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree
            - The in-degree of a vertex v, denoted by deg-(v), is the number of edges with v as their terminal vertex
            - The out-degree, denoted byu deg+(v), is the number of edges with v as their initial vertex
            - Theorem 3 - for a directed graph, in-degree of a vertex is equal to out-degree of vertex
        - Some Special Simple Graphs
            - Complete Graph - simple graph that contains exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices
            - Cycles - n >= 3, consists of n vertices and edges (v1, v2), (v2, v3), (v3, v4)
            - Wheel - add an additional vertex to a cycle, for n >= 3, and connect this new vertex to each of the n vertices in the cycle
            - N Cube - graph that has vertices representing the 2^n bit strings of length n
            - Special Types of Network Graphs - Star, Ring, Hybrid
        - Bipartite Graphs - graph has property that its vertex set can be divided into two disjoint subsets such that each edge connects a vertex in one of these subsets to a vertex in the other subset
            - If triangle, then not bipartite
            - Complete Bipartite - edge from every vertex in V1 to every vertex in V2
        - New Graphs from Old
            - UInion of Two Simple Graphs - put vertices together and add edges
            - Subgraph - G = (V,E) subgraph H (W, F) where W is subset of V and F subset of E
    c. Representing Graphs and Graphs Isomorphism
        - Adjaceny Lists - specify the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph
        - Adjaceny Matrices - n x n zero one matrix with 1 as its entry when vi and vj are adjacent and 0 when they are not
        - Incidence Matrices - n x m matrice where 1 when edge is incident with v and 0 otherwise
        - Isomorphism of Graphs - G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are isomorphic if there exists a one to one and onto function f from V1 to V2 with the property that a and b are adjacent in G1 if and only if f(a) and f(b) are adjacent in G2
            - Trick, compare highest degrees of vertexes for a quick check
            - Check vertex with matching degrees and check adjacent vertices for different degrees
    d. Connectivity
        - Introduction
        - Paths
            - Path - sequence of edges that begins at a vertex of a graph and travels from vertex to vertex along edges of the graph
                - Edges - e1, e2, e3, e4, e5
                - Vertices - u, x0, x1, x2, xn, v
            - Simple Path - if it does not contain the same edge more than once
            - Applications
                - Determining whether a message can be sent between two computers
                - Efficiently planning routes for mail delivery
        - Connectedness
            - Graph is called connectred if there is a path between every pair of distinc vertices of the graph
            - Connected Components - connected subgraph of G that is not a proper subgraph of another connected subgraph of G
            - Cut Vertices - the removal of this vertex and all incident edges produces a graph with more connected components i.e. produces a subgraph that is not connected
            - K-conneceted - k(G) >= k
                - k(G) = 0, disconnected graphs
                - k(G) = 1, graphs without cut vertices that can be disconnected by removing one vertex
        - Edge Connectivity
            - Measure connectivity of a connected graph G in terms of the minimum number of edges that we can remove to disconnect it
        - Connectedness in Directed Graphs
            - Strongly Connected - if there is a path from a to b and from b to a whenever a and b are vertices in the graph, must be a sequence of directed edges fropm any vertex in the graph to any other vertex
            - Weakly Connected - if there is a path between every two vertices in the underlying undirected graph
        - Strong Components of a Directed Graph - subgraphs of a directed graph G that are strongly connected bu tnot contained in larger strong connected subgraphs, that is, the maximal strongly connected subgraphs, are called the strongly connected components or strong components of G
        - Theorems
            - There is a simple path between every pair of distinct vertices of a connected undirected graph
    e. Euler and Hamilton Paths
        - Euler Circuit - can we travel along the edges of a graph starting at a vertex and returning to it by traversing each edge of the graph exactly once?
        - Hamilton Path - can we travel along the edges of a graph starting at a vertex and returning to it while visiting each vertex of the graph exactly once?
        - Euler Paths and Circuits
            - Seven Bridges of Konigsberg - no solution, what is notable is how Euler PROVED it had no solution
            - Euler Circuit - simple circuit in graph G containing every edge of G
            - Euler Path - simple path containing every edge of G
        - Necessary and Sufficient Conditiosn for Euler Circuits and Paths
            - Show every vertex must have an even degree
        - Theorem
            - A connected multigraph with at least two vertices has an Euler circuit if and only if each of its vertices has even degree
            - A connected multigraph has an Euler path but not an Euler circuit if and only if it has exactly two vertices of odd degree
