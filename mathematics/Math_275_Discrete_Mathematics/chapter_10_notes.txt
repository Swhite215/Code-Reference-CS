Chapter 10: Graphs
    a. Graph Terminology
        - Graph - consists of vertices or nodes and edges
        - Directed Graph - consists of vertices and directed edges, each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices, start at u and end at v
        - Types
            - Simple
            - Multigraph
            - Pseudograph
            - Simple Directed
            - Directed Multigraph
            - Mixed Graph
        - Regular - if every vertx has the same degree
    b. Graph Terminology and Special Types of Graphs
        - Basic Terminology
            - Two vertices u and v in an undirected graph G are called adjacent if u and v are endpoints of an edge e. Edge e is called incident with u and v and is said to connect u and v
            - Neighborhood - N(A) all vertices in G that are adjacent to at least one vertex in A
            - Degree - degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident with it, except that loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree
            - Theorem 1 (Handshaking Theorem) - sum of the degrees of the vertices of an undirected graph is even
            - Theorem 2 - an undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree
            - The in-degree of a vertex v, denoted by deg-(v), is the number of edges with v as their terminal vertex
            - The out-degree, denoted byu deg+(v), is the number of edges with v as their initial vertex
            - Theorem 3 - for a directed graph, in-degree of a vertex is equal to out-degree of vertex
        - Some Special Simple Graphs
            - Complete Graph - simple graph that contains exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices
            - Cycles - n >= 3, consists of n vertices and edges (v1, v2), (v2, v3), (v3, v4)
            - Wheel - add an additional vertex to a cycle, for n >= 3, and connect this new vertex to each of the n vertices in the cycle
            - N Cube - graph that has vertices representing the 2^n bit strings of length n
            - Special Types of Network Graphs - Star, Ring, Hybrid
        - Bipartite Graphs - graph has property that its vertex set can be divided into two disjoint subsets such that each edge connects a vertex in one of these subsets to a vertex in the other subset
            - If triangle, then not bipartite
            - Complete Bipartite - edge from every vertex in V1 to every vertex in V2
        - New Graphs from Old
            - UInion of Two Simple Graphs - put vertices together and add edges
            - Subgraph - G = (V,E) subgraph H (W, F) where W is subset of V and F subset of E
    c. Representing Graphs and Graphs Isomorphism
        - Adjaceny Lists - specify the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph
        - Adjaceny Matrices - n x n zero one matrix with 1 as its entry when vi and vj are adjacent and 0 when they are not
        - Incidence Matrices - n x m matrice where 1 when edge is incident with v and 0 otherwise
        - Isomorphism of Graphs - G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are isomorphic if there exists a one to one and onto function f from V1 to V2 with the property that a and b are adjacent in G1 if and only if f(a) and f(b) are adjacent in G2
            - Trick, compare highest degrees of vertexes for a quick check
            - Check vertex with matching degrees and check adjacent vertices for different degrees
