Fundamentals of Linux
    1.History
      a. What is Linux?
        - An operating system, a collection of software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment where applications can run.
        - A Kernel, core of the OS, sits between hardware and applications.
        - Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, 1st version released in 1994
        - Free Open Source Software
      b. What is a Linux Distribution?
        - A Kernel plus additional software that can be changed
        - Examples: DistroWatch.com
          - Red Hat Enterprise License - CentOS derivative
            - Banks, Airlines, Telecoms, Healthcare
          - Fedora
          - Ubuntu
            - Startups, SaaS, Social Networks, Cloud Based
          - Debian
        - Distro/Flavor are common terms
      c. Why Linux?
        - Runs on many hardware platforms
        - Small footprint
        - Stable, Reliable, Secure
        - Great for Servers
        - FOSS
    2.SSH
        a. What is SSH?
            - Secure Shell, software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks
            - Invented by Tatu Ylonen
            - Windows Client - PuTTY
        b. Connecting
            - ssh remoteComputer
            - ssh username@remoteComputer
            - ssh -l username remoteComputer
        c. Commands
            - ssh hostname command
            - ssh-keygen, tool for creating new authentication key pairs for ssh
                - ssh-keygen -t [rsa, dsa, ecdsa, ed25519] -b [rsa: 2048, 4096] [ecdsa: 256, 384, 521]
                    - -t is algorithm and -b is key size
                - ssh-keygen -f ~/path -t rsa -b 2048
            - ssh-copy-id, copy public key to server and installed in authorized_keys file
                - ssh-copy-id -i ~/path user@host
            - ssh-agent, helper program to implement single sign-on
                - eval `ssh-agent`, starts ssh-agent
                - echo $SSH_AGENT_SOCK,check if ssh-agent has been used
            - ssh-add, adds identities to agent
                - ssh-add, add default files to agent
                    - ~/.ssh/id_rsa, .ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,~/.ssh/ed25519, ~/.ssh/identity
                - ssh-add -l, lists private keys currently accessible to the agent
         d. Additional Commands
            - scp, a program for copying files between computers
                - scp file host:path, copy to
                - scp host:path file, copy from
                - scp -r directory host:path
            - sftp, secure file transfer protocol
                - sftp host
            - sshd, OpenSSH server process
    3. Directory Structure
        a. Common Directories
            - / , Root, the top of the file system hierarchy
            - /bin, Binaries and other executable programs
            - /etc, System configuration files
            - /home, User home directories
            - /opt, Optional or third party software
            - /tmp, Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot
            - /usr, User related programs
            - /var, Variable data, most notably log files
        b. Other Important Directies
            - /cdrom, Mount point for CD-ROMs
            - /cgroup, Control Groups hierarchy
            - /boot, files needed to boot the operating system
            - /dev, device files, typically controlled by the operating system and the adminstrators
            - /export, shared file systems
            - /lib, System libraries
            - /media, Used to mount removable media like CD-ROMs
            - /mnt, Used to moutn external files systems
            - /proc, Provides info about running processes
            - /sbin, System administration binaries
            - /selinux, Used to display information about SELinux
            - /srv, Contains data which is served by the system
            - /srv/www. Web server files
            - /srv/ftp, FTP files
            - /sys, Used to display and sometimes configure the devices known to the linux kernel
            - /usr/bin, Binaries and other executable programs
            - /user/local, locally installed software that is not part of the base operating system
        c. Application Directory Structures
            - usr/local/programname/path
            - opt/organizationname
    4. Shell
        a. What is the shell?
            - Default user interface to a linux system
            - Start a terminal to gain access to a shell if you start in a GUI
            - A program that accepts your commands and executes those commands
            - Often times more powerful
            - Shell Prompt
                - username@linuxSystem
                - $ using as normal user
                - # super user or root
                - current directory
                - ~ represents home directory
        b. How do you access the shell?
            - Open the terminal...
        c. What is the super user account?
            - A powerful account
            - Access restricted to system administrators
            - Access may be required to install, start, or stop an application
            - Day to day will be performed by a normal account
    5. PATH
        a. What is Path?
            - An environment variable
            - Controls the command search path
            - Contains a list of directories
