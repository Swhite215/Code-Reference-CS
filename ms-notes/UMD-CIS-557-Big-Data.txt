Big Data

1. 01/06/2025 - Introduction
    - Course Objectives
        - Big Data Concepts
        - Technologies
        - Processing and Techniques
    - What is Data Mining?
        - Big Data - no standard term
        - Generators - almost everyone and every device
        - Dumo - Data has changed over time
        - Goal - extract knowledge and model from data
    - Three V
        - Volume - size (gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes)
        - Velocity - speed
        - Variety - types
    - Directions in Modeling
        - Statistical Modeling - describes the distribution of data e.g. Gaussian is mean and standard deviation
        - Predictive Methods - use some variabels to predict unknown or futrue values of other variables
    - Machine Learning Classification
        - Topic - movies and tv shows
        - Data - Instance - Record - Entry - Data Point
        - Features - length, genre, seasons
        - Goal - map rows and columns into open space, where every column is an axis in your space, orthogonal to each other
        - Decision Boundary - separation between classifications based on features
        - Prediction - input feature values and map them to the open space and then based on decision boundary return classification
        - Training Set - produces decision boundary
        - Test Set - unknown data that will be classified
        - Overfit - performance on training set is so high it is difficult to map new data
