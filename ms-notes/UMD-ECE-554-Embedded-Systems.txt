Embedded Systems ECE 554

1. Lecture 1
    - System Concepts
        - Define - mapping of a set of inputs into a set of ouptuts
        - Stimulus - input
        - Behavior - response
        - Response Time - time between stimulus and behavior
        - Embedded System - hardware/software computer system embedded within and controlling a product
        - Real Time System - system that must satisfy explicit bounded response time constrains or risk servere consequences including failure
            - Airplane Surface Flight Controller, Reservation System, Computer Game
        - Failed System - A system that cannot satisfy one or more of the requirements stipulated in the system specification
        - Real Time System - one whose logical correctness is based on both the correctness of the outputs and their timeliness
        - Soft Real Time System - one in which performance is degraded but not destroyed by failure to meet constraints on response time
        - Firm Real Time System - missing more than a few deadlines may lead to complete and catastrophic system failure
        - Hard Real Time System - missing a single deadling may lead to complete and catastrophic system failure
        - Event - causes the proigram counter to change nonsequentially
            - Synchronous - occur at predictable times
            - Asynchronous - occur at unpredictable times
            - Aperiodic - do not occur at regular intervals
            - Sporadic - aperiodic that occur infrequently
            - Periodic - occur at regular intervals
        - Release Time - time at which an instance of a scheduled task is ready to run, generally associated with an interrupt
        - Determinism - for each possible state and each set of inputs, a unique set of outputs and next state of the system can be determined
        - Time Loading - CPU utilization U is a measure of non-idle processing
            - U = Summations from 1 to N of ei/pi
            - 0-25%
            - 26-50% - Very Safe
            - 51-68% - Safe
            - 69% - Theoretical Limit
            - 70-82% - Questionable
            - 83-99% - Dangerous
            - 100+ - Overloaded
