        - Failed System - A system that cannot satisfy one or more of the requirements stipulated in the system specification
        - Real Time System - one whose logical correctness is based on both the correctness of the outputs and their timeliness
        - Soft Real Time System - one in which performance is degraded but not destroyed by failure to meet constraints on response time
        - Firm Real Time System - missing more than a few deadlines may lead to complete and catastrophic system failure
