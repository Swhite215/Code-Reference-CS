1. 01/06/2025 - Introduction
    - Topics
        - Basic Concepts
        - Entity Relationship Model
        - Relational Model
        - Relational Algebra
        - SQL Language
        - Missing Information and Views
        - Database Design
        - Query Optimization
        - Transaction Management
        - Non-Relational DBs and DB Security
    - Definitions
        - Data - facts or values obtained from observation or measurement
        - Information - interpretation of facts
        - Database (DB) - a collection of related persistent data used by an enterprise
            - Schema - description of the data (intension), changes infrequently
            - Instance - collection of data stored in the database at a particular moment in time (extension), changes frequently
        - Database System
            - Metadata - data about other data
            - Metalanguage - language used to describe another language 
            - Metasearch - search engine making use of other search engines
            - Software - database management system, utilities (loading, reorganizing, backup, analyzing), tools (design, development)
            - Hardware - secondary storage, memory, processors, DB machine
            - Users - users of database system
    - How to Manage Persistent Data
        - File Processsing - each application mananges its own information
            - Issues - redundancy, inconsistency
        - Database - data are integrated and shared
            - Benefits - reduction of redundancy, efforts, consistency, sharing, independence (change strucutre without affecting program) and abstraction, views, security restrictions, integrity constraints, data deduction, data retrieval
    - Data Independence - ability to modify a schema at one level without affecting the schema at the next higher level
        - Three Schema Architecture (ANSI/SPARC)
            - Internal Level - how data is stored in the storage medium
            - Conceptual Level - describes the logical structure of the entire DB
            - External Level - describes the part of the DB that a particular user group is interested in
        - Physical Data Independence - change internal schema without affecting conceptual schema or external schema
        - Logical - change conceptual schema without affecting external schemas
    - Data Model - a set of concepts for describing data types, relationships, constraints, semantics, and behaviors
        - Conceptual - object based logical models, describe data in terms of objects and interrelationships
            - Close to the way many users perceive data
            - Conceptual and external schemas
            - Examples - entity relationship model, object oriented model, semantic model, functional model
        - Implementation - record based logical model
            - Represent data using record structure
            - Conceptual and external schemas
            - Relational model, network model, hierarchical model
        - Physical Data Model - how data is stored in the computer
            - Internal schemas
            - Unifying model and frame memory
    - Database Lanaguage (DBL)
        - What - schema specifications
            - View Definition Lanaguage - external
            - Data Definition Language - conceptual
            - Storage Definition Language - internal schema
        - What - data manipulation
            - Data Manipulational Language (retrieve, insert, delete, modify, update)
        - What - data control
        - Data Control Language (privilege, transaction)
        - Uses of Database Language
            - Stand Alone - interactive, unplanned, data manipulation language (DML)
            - Embedded - embeded in host language, planned request, data sublanguage (DSL)
        - Unified Language
            - Database Programming Language - add DBL features to programming language
            - 4th Generation Language - add programming language to DBL
    - Other Interfaces
        - Call Level ODBC
        - Call Level JDBC
        - Menu, Form, Graphic, Natural Language, Voice, Combination
    - Database Users
        - Application Programmers, Casual, Parametric, Sophisticated, Stand Alone
        - Casual - interactive queries
        - Parametric - canned transactions
        - Sophisticated - full DBL
        - Stand Alone - menu/graphic interfaces
        - Database Administrator
            - Logical Design of Conceptual Schema
            - Internal Schema of Physical Design
            - External Schema for Users
            - Security Checks
            - DBS Maintenance (backup, recovery, performance)
