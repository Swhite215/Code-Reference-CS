        - Client/Server Model - HTTP, SMTP, ICMP, SSH, DNS
    - Open System Interconnection Model
        - Physical - physical/electrical characteristics, binary data, cable, connectors, voltage, signal duration
            - Low frequency = longer wavelengths, low data rates, long distances, penetrate objects
            - High frequency = shorter wavelengths, high data rates, short distances, line of sight
            - Wavelength = Speed of Light / Frequency
        - Propogation Behaviors
            - Ground Wave < 2MHz - follow earth's surface, long distances
            - Sky Wave 2-30MHz - reflectd at ionosphere around the world
            - Line of Sight >30MHz - straight lines, waves are bent at atmosphere due to refraction
            - Effects - shadowing, reflection, refraction, scattering, diffraction
        - Signal Propogation Ranges
            - Transmission Range - communication possible, low error rate
            - Detection Range - detection possible, no communication possible
            - Interference Range - signal may not be detected, signal adds to background noise
        - Multipath Propogation
            - Signal may take different paths between sensor and receiver due to reflection, scattering, and diffraction
        - Modulation
            - Digital - digial data is translated into an analog signal
            - Amplitude Key Shifting - amplitude is varied to represent binary data
            - Frequency Key Shifting - frequency is varied to represent binary data (Binary or Multiple Frequency)
            - Amplitude Modulation AM - amplitude, measure of amount of energy transferred by a wave, distance between peak or trough and equilibrium
            - Frequency Modulation FM - number of waves that pass a certain point in a certain period of time
            - Phase Modulation
    - Data - frames, Media Access Control sublayer
        - How/when medium is accessed for transmission, frames, error detection/correction
        - Multiplexing
            - Space Multiplexing - different paths or channels for each signal
            - Time Multiplexing - different interval, each signal assigned to an interval
            - Frequency Multiplexing - different frequencies, each signal assign to a frequency
            - Code Multiplexing - assign unique code to channel or user, receivers uses code to extract desired information
        - Ethernet
            - Local Area Network technology
            - Carrier Sense Multiple Access, Collision Detection
        - Wireless Transmissions
            - Signal = Signal to Interference plus Noise Ration
            - Signal Power - decreases as distance increases
            - Terminals
                - Hidden Terminal (A -> B <- C) - C does not hear A, and A cannot hear C, but C can interfere with A at B and should NOT transmit
                - Exposed Terminal (Y <- X - A -> B) - X hears A and wants to Transmit to Y, it cannot interfere with A at B and should transmit
            - 802.11 Wireless
                - Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance
                    - Sender Emit Request to Send RTS
                    - Receiver Emits Clear to Send CTS
                    - Others Silenced
                    - Sender Emits
                - Exponetial Backoff
                    - Wait random time before transmitting, if collision, exponential backoff, once transmit, reset rand to 0
    - Network - Internet Protocol, addressing and routing
        - Internet Protocol
        - Address and Routing - Sender/Receiver IP Addresses
            - 32bit hierarchical address space e.g. 128.100.11.156
                - Network ID
                - Host ID
            - IPv4
                - Class A - Network.Host.Host.Host
                - Class B - Network.Network.Host.Host
                - Class C - Network.Network.Network.Host
            - IPv6
                - 128 Bits
                - 16 Byte Hexadecimal
        - Routers
            - Consume source and destination IP address
            - Route to Next Hop dependening on destination IP address
    - Transport - User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Transmission Control Protcool (TCP)
        - Port - which application on a specific computer
        - User Datagram Protocol - unreliable, lost or out of order packets
        - Transmission Control Protocol - reliable, in order packet delivery
            - Adds flow control and congestion control
    - Session - authentication, management
    - Presentation - data translation, formatting, encryption, compression
    - Application - interface between user applications and lower network services
    - TCP/IP Model
        - Application maps to Application, Presentation, Session
        - Transport maps to Transport
        - Network maps to Network
        - Network Interface maps to Data Link and Physical
