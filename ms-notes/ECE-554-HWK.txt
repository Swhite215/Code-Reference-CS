3. PG 25 1.8 Response Time Elevator
    - The timing must ensure the passenger is not hurt if the door makes contact.
    - Times to Consider
        - Sensor, Hardware, System Software, Application Software, Door Driver

4. PG 25 1.10 CPU Utilization Factor
    - 17/500 + 4/25 + 1/75 + 20/200 = .31
    - Questionable = 70-82% - 82%
    - .82 = x/500 + 4/25 + 1/75 + 20/200
    - .82 = x/500 + .16 + .013R + .1
    - .82 = x/500 + .273
    - .547 = x/500
    - 273ms
