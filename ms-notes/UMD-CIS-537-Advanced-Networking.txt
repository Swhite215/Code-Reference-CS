        - Services and Protocols
            - Service - capabilities enabled by the network that users make use of
            - Protocols - networking rules/standards/policies that govern how data is structured, transmitted, and processed in the network

        - Designing Networks
            - Business Requirements - who, what, where, why
                - Who is using the network?
                - What service is being provided by the network?
                - Where are network users located?
            - Technical Concepts/Requirements
                - In order to meet the business requirements what architecture, software, physical components, performance, etc. is needed?

2. 01/18/2024 - Summary of Lecture
    - Main Topics
        - House Keeping
            - Catch up for absent students i.e. review of discussions, assignments, and expectations
        - Evolution of Technology
            - Ethernet, while important as the back bone of much of the wired internet, is largely behind the scenes today given the rise of ubiquitous wireless technologies
            - Capabilities Enabled by Ethernet: VoIP, Media Streaming, Infrastructure for Autonomous Vehicles, etc.
        - Important Groups
            - Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - "What Members are Saying"
            - Association for Computing Machinery
        - General Ethernet Information
            - Physical Link
                - Unshieled Twister Pair, Shielded Twister Pair or Foiled Twister Pair
                - Ethernet Ports and Ethernet Switches
            - Speed of Link - Cat 5, 5e, 6, 6a, 7, 7a, 8
        - Commerical Resource - Cables to Go
        - Types of Ethernet
            - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet
        - Certifications
            - Purpose - professional, relevant, and current proof of skills and knowledge
            - Vendors: CompTIA Network+, Cisco, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, TechTarget Networking
        - Advantages of Ethernet
            - Security, Speed, Reliability, Cost, Compatibility
        - Ethernet Architecture
            - Topologies
                - Bus
                    - All devices are connected to a single bus, and each device analyzes every packet sent through the network
                    - Advantages - ease of use, low cost
                    - Disadvantages - high collision probability and degradation of performance as devices increase
                - Star
                    - All devices are connected to a central device
                    - Hub - Logical Bus - when a message arrives at the hub, it is broadcast to all connected devices
                    - Switch - Logical Bus - when a message arrives at the switch, it is sent directly to the destination device
            - Cable Types
                - Copper Coaxial, Copper Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling, Fiber Optic Cabling
            - Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
                - Carrier Sense - listen to medium to determine if anyone is sending
                - Collision - two messages are sent at the same time and the signals collide
                - Jam Signal - emitted to indicate to all devices on the bus that sending will occur
                - Back Off - waiting a period of time before restarting the CSMA process
                - CSMA is not required with Ethernet and Switches
            - Ethernet Packet
                - Preamble, MAC Destination, MAC Source, Payload, Cyclic Redundancy Check Field
