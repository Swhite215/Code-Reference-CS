        - Culture/History of Networking
            - Professor Othman presented comments on the importance of networking history and the 'relatively' new ubiquitous nature of networking and its consequences
                - Data usage has grown exponentially
                - Access to technology in various forms has grown exponentially
                - New services have grown out of these more performant networks e.g. uber, streaming, etc.
        - Network Examples
            - LAN - local area networks connect hosts up to a distance of tens of kilometers
            - MAN - metropolitan area networks connect hosts up to a distance of hundreds of kilometers
            - WAN - wide area networks connect hosts located anywhere on Earth
        - Network Components
            - Hosts (Clients, Servers), Links (Wireless, Physical)
            - Topologies - Mesh, Star, Bus, Ring, Tree
        - Services and Protocols
            - Service - capabilities enabled by the network that users make use of
            - Protocols - networking rules/standards/policies that govern how data is structured, transmitted, and processed in the network
        - Open System Interconnection Model
            - What - a conceptual model concerning system interconnection
            - Please Do Not Throw Spencer's Pizza Away (PDNTSPA)
                - Physical, Data, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
        - Designing Networks
            - Business Requirements - who, what, where, why
                - Who is using the network?
                - What service is being provided by the network?
                - Where are network users located?
            - Technical Concepts/Requirements
                - In order to meet the business requirements what architecture, software, physical components, performance, etc. is needed?
