    - View of Operating System
        - Kernel - Mono vs. Micro
            - Monolithic - shared, + performance, - security
            - Micro - isolated, message passing, +security, - performance
        - Application Programming Interface
            - System Call Implementation
                - Name = Unique ID
                - Unique ID - optimized look up of call through index into an array
            - Parameter Passing
                - Registers - fast, normally only a few registers are available
                - Block Memory - store all, pass starting in a list, immediate access by memory address multiple times
                - Stack - push and pop, must push and pop to target value
            - Types of System Call
                - File Management
                - Memory Management
                - Communication
                - Parallel Programming
            - Background Services/Processes
                - Background - process started, memory allocated, put process to sleep
        - Design
            - Policy - what will be done
            - Mechanism - how will it be done
        - Layered Approach
            - Layer 0 (Hardware) -> Layer X (Kernel) -> Layer N (User)
        - Microkernel System Structure
            - Positive - separation of concerns, modularity, reduction of bugs
            - Negative - communication between microkernels,
            - Goal - essential kernel mode functionality is encapsulated as independent kernels that communication with each other
            - Other - Loadable Kernel Module
    - SMP vs. AMP
        - Multiprocessing/Multiprocessors
            - Why:
                - Limitation of a single CPU
                - Multiple Users
                - Multiple Applications
                - Multi-Tasking
                - Responsiveness and Throughput
            - Issue: how do I make use of multiple processors?
        - Symmetric Multiprocessing - all cores are treated equally
        - Asymmetric Multiprocessing - one or more cores are specialized
        - Instructions and Data Streams
            - Single Instruction Single Data - single instruction on single piece of data (traditional)
            - Multiple Instruction Multiple Data - multiple instructions for multiple pieces of data
            - Single Instruction Multiple Data - same instruction on multiple pieces of data (graphics processing)
            - Multiple Instruction Single Data - redundancy, verification
        - Processor Coupling
            - Tightly Coupled - CPUs are connected over a bus
                - + access to a shared central memory
            - Loosely Coupled - processors interconnected via a high speed communication system
                - + isolation
        - Architectures
            - Message Passing
                - - latency
                - + isolation
            - Shared Memory - multiple programs acceessing same memory
                - + low latency, easy
        - Memory Access
            - Bus Based Uniform Memory Access - access time for each CORE is uniform
            - Non Uniform Based Memory Access - access time to local memory for process is faster than access to another processors's remote memory
        - Operating System Distribution
            - Option #1 - OS on all CPUs
            - Option #2 - OS on one CPU, system calls passed to Main CPU for processing
            - Option #3 - Kernel is on everything
