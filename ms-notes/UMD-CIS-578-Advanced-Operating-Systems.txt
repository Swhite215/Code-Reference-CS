    - Introduction
        - Operating System - intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware
        - System Structure
            - Hardware - basic computign resources e.g. CPU, memory, I/O devices
            - Operating System
            - Application Programs - compilers, browsers, database, video games
            - Users - people, machines, other computers
            - Bottom Up - Hardware -> Operating System -> Application Programs -> Users
        - System Definition
            - Resource Allocator - manage all resources, decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
            - Control Program - controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
            - Kernel - program running at all times on the computer
                - Goal - handle core functions that are really important e.g. scheduler
        - Computer Start-Up (Multi-Step)
            - Problem - OS needs to interface with hardware it does not know about
            - Solution - Firmware, enough data to identify locations to load OS
            - Bootstrap Program - BIOS - ROM or EPROM - initialize all aspects of system
        - Organization
            - Memory
            - Bus
            - Components - CPU, Disk, USB, Graphiucs
        - Interrupt
            - Trap or Exception to generate an interrupt
            - Control transfers to the interrupt service routine through the interrupt vector, address of all service routines
            - Alternative - Polling
            - Interrupt Handling
                - Preserve state of the CPU by storing registers and program counter
                - State - values in registers, program execution point, stack, heap, program code
        - Storage Hierarchy
            - Registers (Fast, Expensive, Small)
            - Cache
            - Main Memory
            - Solid State Disk
            - Hard Disk
            - Optical Disk
            - Magnetic Tapes (Slow, Cheap, Large)
            - Access Time - .n nanoseconds to 5m nanoseconds
        - Caching
            - Storing important, frequently used data, closer to the CPU
            - If data in cache, cache hit, if not, cache miss, must load data to cache
        - Direct Memory Access
            - For certain devices, driver should talk directly to memory, improving speed of system
            - Data can be transferred in a block
            - CPU is not involved
        - How a Modern Computer Works - Von Neumann
            - Program, Data - Sequence of Bytes
            - Simplify to handle instructions
        - Processing
            - Multiprocessor Architecture - single main memory, multiple CPUs
            - Asymmetric - each processor is assigned a specific task
            - Symmetric - each processor performs all tasks
        - Multi-Programming
            - Organization of jobs so CPU always has one to execute
            - Jobs are run via job scheduling
            - A single CPU can be multi-programmed
        - Multi-Threading - single program whose tasks are split amongst multiple threads
        - Timesharing - multiple userrs on a single system, keep CPU busy
        - Modes
            - User - abstracted layer through which user's request access to computer resources
            - Kernel - privileged access to important resources and system calls
            - Transition
                - User Process -> System Call -> Trap to Kernel Mode -> Execute System Call -> Return from Trap
        - Process Management
            - Process - mental model for a program
            - Requirements - CPU, memory, I/O, files, data, program counter, registers
        - Protection and Security
            - Protection - mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS
            - Security - defense of the system against internal and external attacks
            - Users
                - User Identities - name, id, number
                - User ID assocaited with all files
                - Group Identifier - set of users to be defined and controls managed
                - Privilege Escalation - allows user to change to effective ID with more rights
        - Model of Computer Networks/Systems
            - Client/Server - client communicates with hosted servers
            - Peer to Peer - clients directly communication with each other
    - OS Structure
        - Operating System Services
            - user interface, program execution, I/O operations, file system, communications, error detection
            - resource allocation, accounting, protection and security
