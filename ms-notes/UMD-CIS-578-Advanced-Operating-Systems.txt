        - Caching
            - Storing important, frequently used data, closer to the CPU
            - If data in cache, cache hit, if not, cache miss, must load data to cache
        - Direct Memory Access
            - For certain devices, driver should talk directly to memory, improving speed of system
            - Data can be transferred in a block
            - CPU is not involved
        - How a Modern Computer Works - Von Neumann

        - Processing
            - Multiprocessor Architecture - single main memory, multiple CPUs
            - Asymmetric - each processor is assigned a specific task
            - Symmetric - each processor performs all tasks
        - Multi-Programming
            - Organization of jobs so CPU always has one to execute
            - Jobs are run via job scheduling
            - A single CPU can be multi-programmed
        - Multi-Threading - single program whose tasks are split amongst multiple threads
        - Timesharing - multiple userrs on a single system, keep CPU busy
        - Modes
            - User - abstracted layer through which user's request access to computer resources
            - Kernel - privileged access to important resources and system calls
            - Transition
                - User Process -> System Call -> Trap to Kernel Mode -> Execute System Call -> Return from Trap
        - Process Management
            - Process - mental model for a program
            - Requirements - CPU, memory, I/O, files, data, program counter, registers
        - Protection and Security
            - Protection - mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS
            - Security - defense of the system against internal and external attacks
            - Users
                - User Identities - name, id, number
                - User ID assocaited with all files
                - Group Identifier - set of users to be defined and controls managed
