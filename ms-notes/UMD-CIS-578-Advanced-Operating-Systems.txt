    - Multitasking in Mobile Systems
        - Foreground Process - controlled via user interface
        - Background Process - in memory, running, but not on display, cost on resources if background process number grows unbounded
    - Queues
        - Ready Queue - linked list of PCBs
        - Device Queue - for each device, a linked list of PCBs, offloaded work for file access
    - Process Creation - fork() and exec()
        - Tree of Processes in Linux
            - Create first process - must load this process directly from memory on init, must be coded and defined e.g. assembly language
            - Process ID 1 - starts other procesess
            - Question - every process is a child of what process? init
        - fork() - system call to create a new process, why, duplicate of parent, change PCB to new contents i.e. new program
        - exec() - system call used after fork() to create a new process
        - exit() - system call used to end execution
        - wait() - system call used by parent to wait for child
        - If parent or child never terminate, they never release their resources
        - Improvement - dont copy all data if all is not going to be used, waste of energy
    - Process Termination
        - Cascading termination - all children etc
        - How is Chrome like a mini operating system? Multiple processes that handle specific tasks
    - Interprocess Communication
        - Message Passing
            - Good - process are isolated, security
            - Bad - messages add overhead
        - Shared Memory
            - Good - fast, easy to setup, good performance
            - Bad - if any process corrupts memory, it affects the other, security
        - Cooperasting Processes
            - Independent - process cannot affedct or be affected by exeuction of another
            - Cooperating - process can affect or be affected by execution of another process
        - Direct Communication
            - Process A -> Process B
            - A communication link must be established
        - Indirect Communication (Mailbox)
            - Messages are directed and received from mailboxes
            - Link established if process share a common mailbox
        - Communication
            - stdin, stdout, stderr
            - dir | sort > output.txt
    - Synchronization
        - Blocking (synchronous, order is preserved, wasting time)
            - Blocking Send - sender is blocked until the message is received
            - Blocking Receive - receiver is blocked until a message is available
        - Non-Blocking (asynchronous)
            - Non-Blocking Send - sender sends the message and continues
            - Non-Blocking Receive - receiver receives valid or null
    - Buffering
        - Queues of messages attached to the link
        - Zero Capacity - no messages are queued
        - Bounded Capacity - sender must wait if link full
        - Unbounded Capacity - sender never waits
    - Socket
        - Endpoint for communication, IP and Port
        - < 1024 are well known ports
        - 127.0.01 - loopback
    - Pipe
        - Conduit allowing two processes to communicate
        - Ordinary Pipe - parent child relationship, unidirectional, producer writes to one end, consumer reads from other end
        - Direction: Unidirectional vs. Bidirectional
    - Signals
        - Events emitted, that can be processed with a signal handler to perform a certain task
        - Security - how do you avoid signals emitted from programs from affecting others? - user control
    - Threads
        - Concurrency vs. Parallelism
            - Concurrency - multiple processes on single core
            - Parallelism - multiple concurrent processes on multiple cores
        - Single Thread vs. Multi Threaded
            - Threads can share code, data, and files
            - Threads have their own registers and stack
            - Context Switch between threads in the same process is faster than context switch between two processes
