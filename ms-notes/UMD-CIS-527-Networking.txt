                    - How do we communicate?
                        - Networks must use standard protocol - IPv4 and IPv6
            - Addressing and Routing
                - Address - byte string that identifies a node, usually unique
                    - MAC 48 bits - 2.8147498e+14
                    - IPV4 32 Bits - 4294967296
                    - IpV6 128 Bits - 3.4028237e+38
                - Types of Addresses
                    - Uncast - node specific
                    - Broadcast - all nodes on the network, limited to "local" network
                    - Multicast - some subset of nodes on the network, can be anywhere on the internet
                        - Limited - relatively hard to implement, requires designing a tree, incorporating many networks, multiple sends
                - Routing
                    - What - process of forwarding mesages to the destination mode based on its address
                    - Issue - maintaining records of routers, we must be able to aggregate
            - Strategies
                - Circuit Switching - carry bit streams, reservation based
                    - Original telephone network - need to share the same link
                    - Time Divison Multiplexing - switch between L1, L2, L3 using configured time slots
                        - Issue - time slots are wasted if host has nothing to share
                        - How do you determine period of time slot?
                            - Depends on the need of the application i.e. the data rate
                        - Issue - requires entire set of links and circuits to be set up
                    - Frequency-Divison Multiplexing - any data can be sent over any frequency using signal encoding
                    - Telephone - makes sense because connection is persistent, take samples per second one byte
                - Packet Switching - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - On-Demand Time Division
                    - Schedule the link on a per packet basis, more effectively uses the link
                    - Packets from different sources are interleaved on link
                    - Buffer packets that are contending for the link
                    - Issue - congestion at the link, incoming rate is larger than link buffer i.e buffer congestion
                        - We need to provide feedback to source nodes to alter their rate of packet submissions
                    - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - Technique - Store and Forward
                        - Forward - Table Lookup using the destination address
                    - Fault Tolerance
                        - If link has failed, network can adapt to changing circumstances to still deliver packet to target destination
                - Data
                     - Header and Data
                        - Header - Source Address, Destination Address (CONSTANT)
                    - To make it worth using packet switching, your data should be large enough to not be dominated by the header
    - Performance Metrics
        - Bandwidth - data transmitted per unit time
            - How quickly data can be inserted into the network
            - Bit Width - how long it takes to transmit each bit of data
                - E.g. 10Mbs (10 million bits per second), it takes 0.1 microseconds to transmit each bit
            - Notation (speed of the clock) - BITS PER SECOND*
                - 1Kbps - 10^3
                - 1Mbs - 10^5
                - 1B = 8bits
            - Transmit (Insert Time)
                - Transmit Time = Size / Bandwidth

            - One Way
            - Round Trip Time (RTT)
            - Propogation Delay - Distance / speed of light (3.0x10^8 meters/second COAX or 2.0x10^8 meters/second OPTICAL or 2.3*10^8 Copper)
            - Total Time Required to Transfer ( End to End Delay )
                - Transfer Time = Transmit Time + Latency

                - Propogation
        - Bandwidth vs. Latency
            - 1-byte: 1ms vs 100 ms dominates 1Mbs vs 100 Mbps
        - Calculation of Transfer Time
            - 1. Convert Size from Bytes to bits
            - 2. Divide bits Binary bandwidth to determine transmit time
            - 2.5. DETERMINE LATENCY*
            - 3. Add transfer time + latency to determine total transfer time
        - Infinite Bandwidth
            - RTT Dominates
                - Effective Throughput - TransferSize / TransferTime
                - TransferTime = (RTT + 1) / (Bandwidth x Transfer Size)
        - Typical Internet Packet Size - 1Kilobyte
        - Reducing to single bit, you recreate circuit switching, constant stream of bits

        - Video - sequence of frames
            - Frame Size - (352x240 x 24 bits per pixel) = 2027520 bits = 2Mb
            - 30 FPS (frame per second) - 30fps x 2MB/frame = 60Mbps needs to be transmitted, required bandwidth
            - We must compress to reduce the required bandwidth
            - Compression
                - remove redundancy, transmit differences in frame beginning from base frame to derive next frame
                - reduce what of each frame is resent, if there is duplicate values
        - After compression
            - Average Rate = 2Mbps
            - Peak Rate = 3Mbps
        - Decompression - GPU card can perform the task optimally
        - Addressing Jitter
            - Buffer - wait at beginning, and then play out at the target rate
            - Buffer Issue - repeat buffering - caused by not enough bandwidth - bandwidth provided by network is lower than neeeded by application
            - Youtube - adaptive playout - must reduce application need to align with network rate, store multiple versions in different encodings/resolutions for different rates, automatically switch between resolutions

                    - Server sends multiple messages, how do we match client receiving all these messages
                - Issue - TCP Byte Stream
                    - "200 OK\n" + "1001 Test User \m" results in concatenated message
                    - Client must deal with this. If client calls recv(), and server is done sending, now you are blocked
                    - Solution - concatenate entire message, send one message, single receieve, parse
                - Shutdown - optionally terminate client
                - Quit - terminate client

                        - Issues - less flexible and more fragile
                        - Speed of Fiber - limited by how fast we can convert electrical signal to optical
                        - Design - optic ring with active repeaters

                - Bandwidth and Capacity
                    - Bandwidth - width of the frequency range of signal or transmission e.g. human voice 100-3300 Hz, BW is 3200
                    - Capacity - rate in bits per second
                        - Baud Rate - how many symbols per second, speed at which the signal changes
                        - Bit Rate - number of bits /symbol * baud rate

                            - log2(number of symbols)
                        - Example - 8 voltage outputs - 2^3 = 8, so 3 bits can be carried
                - Shannon's Theorem
                    - Maximum bit rate for noisy channel

                        - N = strength of noise - decibels
                        - S/N = 1000, 10log10(1000) = 30 decibels
                    - Always a base noise when transporting, your signal should be stronger than the noise
                    - Maximum Speed thru Telephone Line
                        - BW = 3200HZ - range of human voice and telephone
                        - S/N = 1000
                        - C = 3200 * log2(1 + 1000) = 31,890 bps - Dial Up
                    - Modern Dial Up - 56kbps
                        - To improve, must change (increase or decrease?) signal to noise ratio, e.g. small distance or high quality lines
                    - Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - 16Kbps - 8.448 Mbps
                        - Multiple MB per second

                        - Asymmetric - Download and Upload link speed are different
                        - 1Mhz - 256 channels
                            - Most channel downlink
                            - Fewer channel uplink

    - Encoding (Wired)
        - Idea - signals propogate over a physical medium
            - Modulate electromagnetic waves e.g. vary voltage
        - Encode binary data onto signals
            - 0 as low signal, 1 as high signal
            - Low Voltage vs. High Voltage - what are the voltages?
            - Non-Return to Zero
        - Problem - Consecutive 1s or 0s
            - Baseline Wander - If your signal is high for awhile, it will push the average up, making it difficult to determine low
                - If you travel a long distance, voltage will vary over time
                - The average of the signal strength over time determines low and high
                - Compare the average to the signal received, if higher, than high, and lower, than low
            - Unable to Recover the Clock
                - The number of bits is determined by tbe clock speed
                - Every clock, one bit, sender and receiver need to be precisely synchronized
                - If out of sync, one might interpret more or less data than actually transferred
                - Synchronizing the clock is difficult given their speed
                - If Gbps, clock will change up and down 1 billion times per second
                - Need to periodically resynchronize with other clock
            - How do we synchronize the clcok?
                - Send both the data and clock, this is an expensive option
                - When transition occurs, this is boundary of the clock, and you can adjust your clock based off this value
            - Low Signal (0) may be interpreted as no signal, making it difficult to resync the receiver's clock
            - Goal - always want transitions to enable clock synchronization
        - Alternate Encodings
            - Non-Return to Zero Inverted
                - Make a transition from current signal to encode a one
                - Stay at current signal to encode a zero
                - Solves the problem of consecutive ones
                - Great for data with all ones or alternatives, what about all consecutive zeros?
            - Manchester
                - 0 low to high transition
                - 1 high to low transition
                - Manchester is equivalent to transmit XOR of the NRZ encoded data and the clock
                - Only 50% efficient (the bit rate = half baud rate) - receiver needs to detect transition at twice the speed
                - LOOK AT MIDDLE OF THE CLOCK, SO YOU CAN PREPARE FOR TRANSITIONS
                - Issue - too many transitions, due to consecutive numbers you need two transitions, one as prep, and the actually signal change representing transition
            - 4B/5B (FDDI) - Optical Fiber Array Network and Fast Ethernet
                - Every 4 bits of data encoded in a 5 bit code
                - 5 bit codes to have no more than one leading 0, and nor more than two trailing 0s
                - Thus, never get more than three consecutive 0s
                - Resulting 5-bit codes are transmitted using NRZI
                - Achieves 80% efficiency - transmit 5 bits that carry only 4 bits of data
            - 8B/10B
                - Every 8 bits of data encoded in a 10 bit code
        - Framing
            - Goal - break sequence of bits into a frame
            - Typically implemented by a network adaptor
            - Approaches
                - Sentinel Based Approach
                    - Byte Oriented Protocols
                    - At beginning, send a sequence of characters to sync and declare this is beginning of a new frame, also synchronizes with reciver's clock
                    - 8 SYN, 8 SYN, 8 SCH, Header, 8 STX, Body
                    - At end, send 8 bits for End of Text (ETX)
                    - Cyclial Redundnacy Check 16
                    - Issue, special character SYN or ETX appear in the data portion
                        - Solution Character Stuffing - precede the ETX with a data link escape character
                        - First data link escape character is thrown away
                        - To insert a DLE, insert another DLE - first is thrown away, second is evaluated
                    - Issue - you don't know how many DLE need to be inserted, so it is difficult to make each frame the same size
                - Bit Oriented Protocols
                    - Delineate frame with special pattern 01111110 - beginning and end
                    - Issue - special pattern appears in the payload
                    - Solution - bit stuffing
                        - sender - insert 0 after five consecutive 1s
                            - User Data - 01111110
                            - Stuffed - 011111010
                        - receiver - delete 0 after five consecutive 1s
                    - Can error detect, if you have seven consecutive 1s
                - Counter Based Approaches
                    - SYN, SYN, Class, Count, Header, Body, CRC
                    - Count = size of body or frame
                    - SYN is beginning
                    - Count = size
                    - Count the data up to size, and then frame is over
                    - Problem - count field is corrupted, could negatively impact multiple frames
                    - Solution - catch when CRC fails
                - Clock Based Approach
                    - SONET - Synchronous Optical Network
                    - Each frame is 125us long
                    - STS-N (STS-1 = 51.84 Mbps)
                    - (9 Rows and 10 Columns) 810 bytes / BW = 125us
                    - STS-3 - Speed 3x faster, Size 3x larger
                    - Each row (9), always include two characters SYNC, SYNC
                    - When multiplexing into higher STS, you interleave the bits from the low speed to the high speed
                    - With interleaveing, the data arrives at the speed to match the outgoing lower speed links
                    - Encoding in SONET
                        - NRZ
                        - Sender - XOR of the data by the use of a well known bit patterns (127 bits long)
                        - Receiver - how to invert XOR, XOR on same bit pattern results in original data
                        - Issue, users data is same as bit pattern used for XOR, results in zeros
                        - Solution - be careful when picking 2^127 pattern
        - Error Detection - Frame - Link Layer
            - Goal - how to determine frame is correct
            - Pattern - data + redundancy code, should satify some properties
            - Redundnacy - use a function, pass data, and produce redundancy code
            - Two Dimensional Parity
                - Add parity bit on each row, such that the number of 1s in each row is even
                - Add parity bit on each column, such that the number of 1s in each column is even
                - Can perform recovery of a single bit, given we have row and column
                - Can detect a two bit error, but can not perform a recovery
                - Can detect odd number errors
                - Cannot detect error with same two columns and same two rows....
                - Uses - storage devices
                - Not used much for communication, there is a lot of overhead
            - Internet Checksum Algorithm - sum of 16 bit integers and redundnacy results in all Os
                - View message as a sequence of 16 bit integers
                - Sum using 16 bit ones complement arithmetic
                - Take ones complement of the result, invert direclty
                - Checksum is always the same length, 16 bits
                - Uses - Internet Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol
                - Pro - overhead is relatively low, checksum is always exactly the same
                - Issue - corruption in bits additon lead to same sum
                - SUMMATION
                - Done by software components in network or transport layer
            - Cyclic-Redundancy Check - sum of data and redundancy is divisble by a value
                - Uses - link layer protocols - wifi, ethernet - implemented in network card
                - Pattern
                    - Add k bits of redundant data to an n-bit message, want k << n
                        - You want K much smaller than n
                        - CRC code is always 32 bits for ethernet and wifi
                    - Represent n bit message as an n-1 degree polynomial
                        - MSG - 10011010 - M(X) = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1
                    - Let k be the degree of some divisor polynomial
                        - C(X) = X^3 + x^2 + X^1 = 1101
                        - k = 3
                    - Transmit P(x) that is evenly divisible by C(X)
                        - Shift left k bits
                        - Obtain Remainder - M()
                    - Receiver if you get remainder 0, there are no errors
                        - E(X) was zero, no error
                        - E(X) is exactly divisible by C(X), can't detect the error
                - Polynomial Division
                    - Representedin binary, do XOR NOT numerical analysis
                    - Hardware - XOR and Shift Gates - can be implemented efficiently
                - Selecting C(X)
                    - All single bit errors, as long as the X^k and x^n terms hve non-zero coefficients
                    - All double bit errors, as long as C(X) contains a factor with at lest three terms
                    - Any odd number of errors, as long as C(x) contains the factor (x+1)
                    - Any burst errors (i.e. sequence of error bits) for which the length of the burst is less than k bits
                    - Most burst errors of larger than k bits can also be detected
        - Acknowledgements and Timeouts
            - Goal - how do we ensure reliability?
            - Protocol - Automatice Repeat Request (ARQ)
                - Stop and Wait
                    - Send Single Frame
                    - Receiver Performs Error Detection
                    - Receiver Does or Does Not Send ACK
                    - No Acknowledgement - Sender Repeats
                    - Acknowledgement - Sender Sends New Frame
                    - Problem - keeping the pipe full
                        - Calc = 1.5Mbps link x 45ms RTT = 67.5kb (8kb
                        - 1 KB frame implies 1/8th link utilization
                        - Volume = RTT x BW - data before 1st bit arrives
                    - Solution - Sliding Window
                - Sliding Window
                     - Allow mulitple outstanding frames
                     - Upper bound outstanding frames called window
                     - Window = number of frames allowed to transmit to fill up the pipe
                     - Window = ( RTT x BW ) / Frame Size
                     - Continue sending frames as ACK are received
                     - Resend frame if missing ACK
                     - Ensure reliability and in order delivery - from sender to receiver
                - Concurent Logical Channels
            - Implementation - Transport Layer by TCP
            - Equivalent for Link - Frame Relay or X.25
            - Situations
                - Frame Received but Ack Corrupted - sender still sends, end up with two copies
                - Frame received but Ack delayed for long enough - sender still sends, end up with two copies
                - Solution - for each frame add a sequence number, drop duplicate frames with same sequence number, alternate 0 1
