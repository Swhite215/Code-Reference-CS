                - Issue
                    - How do we uniquely identify each node? 
                        - Internet Protocol Address - Globally Unique - Configurable - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
                        - Routers
                            - IP Addresses for Each Port, Relatively Consistent
                        - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - Local IP Address
                        - Media Access Control Address - Network Card
                    - How do we communicate?
                        - Networks must use standard protocol - IPv4 and IPv6
            - Addressing and Routing
                - Address - byte string that identifies a node, usually unique
                    - MAC 48 bits - 2.8147498e+14
                    - IPV4 32 Bits - 4294967296
                    - IpV6 128 Bits - 3.4028237e+38
                - Types of Addresses
                    - Uncast - node specific
                    - Broadcast - all nodes on the network, limited to "local" network
                    - Multicast - some subset of nodes on the network, can be anywhere on the internet
                        - Limited - relatively hard to implement, requires designing a tree, incorporating many networks, multiple sends
                - Routing
                    - What - process of forwarding mesages to the destination mode based on its address
                    - Issue - maintaining records of routers, we must be able to aggregate
            - Strategies
                - Circuit Switching - carry bit streams, reservation based
                    - Original telephone network - need to share the same link
                    - Time Divison Multiplexing - switch between L1, L2, L3 using configured time slots
                        - Issue - time slots are wasted if host has nothing to share
                        - How do you determine period of time slot?
                            - Depends on the need of the application i.e. the data rate
                        - Issue - requires entire set of links and circuits to be set up
                    - Frequency-Divison Multiplexing - any data can be sent over any frequency using signal encoding
                    - Telephone - makes sense because connection is persistent, take samples per second one byte
                - Packet Switching - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - On-Demand Time Division
                    - Schedule the link on a per packet basis, more effectively uses the link
                    - Packets from different sources are interleaved on link
                    - Buffer packets that are contending for the link
                    - Issue - congestion at the link, incoming rate is larger than link buffer i.e buffer congestion
                        - We need to provide feedback to source nodes to alter their rate of packet submissions
                    - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - Technique - Store and Forward
                        - Forward - Table Lookup using the destination address
                    - Fault Tolerance
                        - If link has failed, network can adapt to changing circumstances to still deliver packet to target destination
                - Data
                     - Header and Data
                        - Header - Source Address, Destination Address (CONSTANT)
                    - To make it worth using packet switching, your data should be large enough to not be dominated by the header
    - Performance Metrics
        - Bandwidth - data transmitted per unit time
            - How quickly data can be inserted into the network
            - Bit Width - how long it takes to transmit each bit of data
                - E.g. 10Mbs (10 million bits per second), it takes 0.1 microseconds to transmit each bit
            - Notation (speed of the clock) - BITS PER SECOND*
                - 1Kbps - 10^3
                - 1Mbs - 10^5
                - 1B = 8bits
            - Transmit (Insert Time)
                - Transmit Time = Size / Bandwidth
        - Latency (Delay) - time it takes a packet to travel from one end of a network to the other
            - One Way
            - Round Trip Time (RTT)
            - Propogation Delay - Distance / speed of light (3.0x10^8 meters/second COAX or 2.0x10^8 meters/second OPTICAL or 2.3*10^8 Copper)
            - Total Time Required to Transfer ( End to End Delay )
                - Transfer Time = Transmit Time + Latency
            - Latency Delay in Packet Switched Networks
                - Nodal Processing - check bit errors
                - Queueing - time waiting at output link for transmission
                - Retransmission
                - Propogation
        - Bandwidth vs. Latency
            - 1-byte: 1ms vs 100 ms dominates 1Mbs vs 100 Mbps
        - Calculation of Transfer Time
            - 1. Convert Size from Bytes to bits
            - 2. Divide bits Binary bandwidth to determine transmit time
            - 2.5. DETERMINE LATENCY*
            - 3. Add transfer time + latency to determine total transfer time
        - Infinite Bandwidth
            - RTT Dominates
                - Effective Throughput - TransferSize / TransferTime
                - TransferTime = (RTT + 1) / (Bandwidth x Transfer Size)
        - Typical Internet Packet Size - 1Kilobyte
        - Reducing to single bit, you recreate circuit switching, constant stream of bits
