                    - How do we communicate?
                        - Networks must use standard protocol - IPv4 and IPv6
            - Addressing and Routing
                - Address - byte string that identifies a node, usually unique
                    - MAC 48 bits - 2.8147498e+14
                    - IPV4 32 Bits - 4294967296
                    - IpV6 128 Bits - 3.4028237e+38
                - Types of Addresses
                    - Uncast - node specific
                    - Broadcast - all nodes on the network, limited to "local" network
                    - Multicast - some subset of nodes on the network, can be anywhere on the internet
                        - Limited - relatively hard to implement, requires designing a tree, incorporating many networks, multiple sends
                - Routing
                    - What - process of forwarding mesages to the destination mode based on its address
                    - Issue - maintaining records of routers, we must be able to aggregate
            - Strategies
                - Circuit Switching - carry bit streams, reservation based
                    - Original telephone network - need to share the same link
                    - Time Divison Multiplexing - switch between L1, L2, L3 using configured time slots
                        - Issue - time slots are wasted if host has nothing to share
                        - How do you determine period of time slot?
                            - Depends on the need of the application i.e. the data rate
                        - Issue - requires entire set of links and circuits to be set up
                    - Frequency-Divison Multiplexing - any data can be sent over any frequency using signal encoding
                    - Telephone - makes sense because connection is persistent, take samples per second one byte
                - Packet Switching - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - On-Demand Time Division
                    - Schedule the link on a per packet basis, more effectively uses the link
                    - Packets from different sources are interleaved on link
                    - Buffer packets that are contending for the link
                    - Issue - congestion at the link, incoming rate is larger than link buffer i.e buffer congestion
                        - We need to provide feedback to source nodes to alter their rate of packet submissions
                    - Statistical Multiplexing
                    - Technique - Store and Forward
                        - Forward - Table Lookup using the destination address
                    - Fault Tolerance
                        - If link has failed, network can adapt to changing circumstances to still deliver packet to target destination
                - Data
                     - Header and Data
                        - Header - Source Address, Destination Address (CONSTANT)
                    - To make it worth using packet switching, your data should be large enough to not be dominated by the header
    - Performance Metrics
        - Bandwidth - data transmitted per unit time
            - How quickly data can be inserted into the network
            - Bit Width - how long it takes to transmit each bit of data
                - E.g. 10Mbs (10 million bits per second), it takes 0.1 microseconds to transmit each bit
            - Notation (speed of the clock) - BITS PER SECOND*
                - 1Kbps - 10^3
                - 1Mbs - 10^5
                - 1B = 8bits
            - Transmit (Insert Time)
                - Transmit Time = Size / Bandwidth

            - One Way
            - Round Trip Time (RTT)
            - Propogation Delay - Distance / speed of light (3.0x10^8 meters/second COAX or 2.0x10^8 meters/second OPTICAL or 2.3*10^8 Copper)
            - Total Time Required to Transfer ( End to End Delay )
                - Transfer Time = Transmit Time + Latency

                - Propogation
        - Bandwidth vs. Latency
            - 1-byte: 1ms vs 100 ms dominates 1Mbs vs 100 Mbps
        - Calculation of Transfer Time
            - 1. Convert Size from Bytes to bits
            - 2. Divide bits Binary bandwidth to determine transmit time
            - 2.5. DETERMINE LATENCY*
            - 3. Add transfer time + latency to determine total transfer time
        - Infinite Bandwidth
            - RTT Dominates
                - Effective Throughput - TransferSize / TransferTime
                - TransferTime = (RTT + 1) / (Bandwidth x Transfer Size)
        - Typical Internet Packet Size - 1Kilobyte
        - Reducing to single bit, you recreate circuit switching, constant stream of bits

        - Video - sequence of frames
            - Frame Size - (352x240 x 24 bits per pixel) = 2027520 bits = 2Mb
            - 30 FPS (frame per second) - 30fps x 2MB/frame = 60Mbps needs to be transmitted, required bandwidth
            - We must compress to reduce the required bandwidth
            - Compression
                - remove redundancy, transmit differences in frame beginning from base frame to derive next frame
                - reduce what of each frame is resent, if there is duplicate values
        - After compression
            - Average Rate = 2Mbps
            - Peak Rate = 3Mbps
        - Decompression - GPU card can perform the task optimally
        - Addressing Jitter
            - Buffer - wait at beginning, and then play out at the target rate
            - Buffer Issue - repeat buffering - caused by not enough bandwidth - bandwidth provided by network is lower than neeeded by application
            - Youtube - adaptive playout - must reduce application need to align with network rate, store multiple versions in different encodings/resolutions for different rates, automatically switch between resolutions

                    - Server sends multiple messages, how do we match client receiving all these messages
                - Issue - TCP Byte Stream
                    - "200 OK\n" + "1001 Test User \m" results in concatenated message
                    - Client must deal with this. If client calls recv(), and server is done sending, now you are blocked
                    - Solution - concatenate entire message, send one message, single receieve, parse
                - Shutdown - optionally terminate client
                - Quit - terminate client

                        - Issues - less flexible and more fragile
                        - Speed of Fiber - limited by how fast we can convert electrical signal to optical
                        - Design - optic ring with active repeaters

                - Bandwidth and Capacity
                    - Bandwidth - width of the frequency range of signal or transmission e.g. human voice 100-3300 Hz, BW is 3200
                    - Capacity - rate in bits per second
                        - Baud Rate - how many symbols per second, speed at which the signal changes
                        - Bit Rate - number of bits /symbol * baud rate

                            - log2(number of symbols)
                        - Example - 8 voltage outputs - 2^3 = 8, so 3 bits can be carried
                - Shannon's Theorem
                    - Maximum bit rate for noisy channel

                        - N = strength of noise - decibels
                        - S/N = 1000, 10log10(1000) = 30 decibels
                    - Always a base noise when transporting, your signal should be stronger than the noise
                    - Maximum Speed thru Telephone Line
                        - BW = 3200HZ - range of human voice and telephone
                        - S/N = 1000
                        - C = 3200 * log2(1 + 1000) = 31,890 bps - Dial Up
                    - Modern Dial Up - 56kbps
                        - To improve, must change (increase or decrease?) signal to noise ratio, e.g. small distance or high quality lines
                    - Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - 16Kbps - 8.448 Mbps
                        - Multiple MB per second

                        - Asymmetric - Download and Upload link speed are different
                        - 1Mhz - 256 channels
                            - Most channel downlink
                            - Fewer channel uplink

    - Encoding (Wired)
        - Idea - signals propogate over a physical medium
            - Modulate electromagnetic waves e.g. vary voltage
        - Encode binary data onto signals
            - 0 as low signal, 1 as high signal
            - Low Voltage vs. High Voltage - what are the voltages?
            - Non-Return to Zero
        - Problem - Consecutive 1s or 0s
            - Baseline Wander - If your signal is high for awhile, it will push the average up, making it difficult to determine low
                - If you travel a long distance, voltage will vary over time
                - The average of the signal strength over time determines low and high
                - Compare the average to the signal received, if higher, than high, and lower, than low
            - Unable to Recover the Clock
                - The number of bits is determined by tbe clock speed
                - Every clock, one bit, sender and receiver need to be precisely synchronized
                - If out of sync, one might interpret more or less data than actually transferred
                - Synchronizing the clock is difficult given their speed
                - If Gbps, clock will change up and down 1 billion times per second
                - Need to periodically resynchronize with other clock
            - How do we synchronize the clcok?
                - Send both the data and clock, this is an expensive option
                - When transition occurs, this is boundary of the clock, and you can adjust your clock based off this value
            - Low Signal (0) may be interpreted as no signal, making it difficult to resync the receiver's clock
            - Goal - always want transitions to enable clock synchronization
        - Alternate Encodings
            - Non-Return to Zero Inverted
                - Make a transition from current signal to encode a one
                - Stay at current signal to encode a zero
                - Solves the problem of consecutive ones
                - Great for data with all ones or alternatives, what about all consecutive zeros?
            - Manchester
                - 0 low to high transition
                - 1 high to low transition
                - Manchester is equivalent to transmit XOR of the NRZ encoded data and the clock
                - Only 50% efficient (the bit rate = half baud rate) - receiver needs to detect transition at twice the speed
                - LOOK AT MIDDLE OF THE CLOCK, SO YOU CAN PREPARE FOR TRANSITIONS
                - Issue - too many transitions, due to consecutive numbers you need two transitions, one as prep, and the actually signal change representing transition
            - 4B/5B (FDDI) - Optical Fiber Array Network and Fast Ethernet
                - Every 4 bits of data encoded in a 5 bit code
                - 5 bit codes to have no more than one leading 0, and nor more than two trailing 0s
                - Thus, never get more than three consecutive 0s
                - Resulting 5-bit codes are transmitted using NRZI
                - Achieves 80% efficiency - transmit 5 bits that carry only 4 bits of data
            - 8B/10B
                - Every 8 bits of data encoded in a 10 bit code
        - Framing
            - Goal - break sequence of bits into a frame
            - Typically implemented by a network adaptor
            - Approaches
                - Sentinel Based Approach
                    - Byte Oriented Protocols
                    - At beginning, send a sequence of characters to sync and declare this is beginning of a new frame, also synchronizes with reciver's clock
                    - 8 SYN, 8 SYN, 8 SCH, Header, 8 STX, Body
                    - At end, send 8 bits for End of Text (ETX)
                    - Cyclial Redundnacy Check 16
                    - Issue, special character SYN or ETX appear in the data portion
                        - Solution Character Stuffing - precede the ETX with a data link escape character
                        - First data link escape character is thrown away
                        - To insert a DLE, insert another DLE - first is thrown away, second is evaluated
                    - Issue - you don't know how many DLE need to be inserted, so it is difficult to make each frame the same size
                - Bit Oriented Protocols
                    - Delineate frame with special pattern 01111110 - beginning and end
                    - Issue - special pattern appears in the payload
                    - Solution - bit stuffing
                        - sender - insert 0 after five consecutive 1s
                            - User Data - 01111110
                            - Stuffed - 011111010
                        - receiver - delete 0 after five consecutive 1s
                    - Can error detect, if you have seven consecutive 1s
                - Counter Based Approaches
                    - SYN, SYN, Class, Count, Header, Body, CRC
                    - Count = size of body or frame
                    - SYN is beginning
                    - Count = size
                    - Count the data up to size, and then frame is over
                    - Problem - count field is corrupted, could negatively impact multiple frames
                    - Solution - catch when CRC fails
                - Clock Based Approach
                    - SONET - Synchronous Optical Network
                    - Each frame is 125us long
                    - STS-N (STS-1 = 51.84 Mbps)
                    - (9 Rows and 10 Columns) 810 bytes / BW = 125us
                    - STS-3 - Speed 3x faster, Size 3x larger
                    - Each row (9), always include two characters SYNC, SYNC
                    - When multiplexing into higher STS, you interleave the bits from the low speed to the high speed
                    - With interleaveing, the data arrives at the speed to match the outgoing lower speed links
                    - Encoding in SONET
                        - NRZ
                        - Sender - XOR of the data by the use of a well known bit patterns (127 bits long)
                        - Receiver - how to invert XOR, XOR on same bit pattern results in original data
                        - Issue, users data is same as bit pattern used for XOR, results in zeros
                        - Solution - be careful when picking 2^127 pattern
        - Error Detection - Frame - Link Layer
            - Goal - how to determine frame is correct
            - Pattern - data + redundancy code, should satify some properties
            - Redundnacy - use a function, pass data, and produce redundancy code
            - Two Dimensional Parity
                - Add parity bit on each row, such that the number of 1s in each row is even
                - Add parity bit on each column, such that the number of 1s in each column is even
                - Can perform recovery of a single bit, given we have row and column
                - Can detect a two bit error, but can not perform a recovery
                - Can detect odd number errors
                - Cannot detect error with same two columns and same two rows....
                - Uses - storage devices
                - Not used much for communication, there is a lot of overhead
            - Internet Checksum Algorithm - sum of 16 bit integers and redundnacy results in all Os
                - View message as a sequence of 16 bit integers
                - Sum using 16 bit ones complement arithmetic
                - Take ones complement of the result, invert direclty
                - Checksum is always the same length, 16 bits
                - Uses - Internet Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol
                - Pro - overhead is relatively low, checksum is always exactly the same
                - Issue - corruption in bits additon lead to same sum
                - SUMMATION
                - Done by software components in network or transport layer
            - Cyclic-Redundancy Check - sum of data and redundancy is divisble by a value
                - Uses - link layer protocols - wifi, ethernet - implemented in network card
                - Pattern
                    - Add k bits of redundant data to an n-bit message, want k << n
                        - You want K much smaller than n
                        - CRC code is always 32 bits for ethernet and wifi
                    - Represent n bit message as an n-1 degree polynomial
                        - MSG - 10011010 - M(X) = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1
                    - Let k be the degree of some divisor polynomial
                        - C(X) = X^3 + x^2 + X^1 = 1101
                        - k = 3
                    - Transmit P(x) that is evenly divisible by C(X)
                        - Shift left k bits
                        - Obtain Remainder - M()
                    - Receiver if you get remainder 0, there are no errors
                        - E(X) was zero, no error
                        - E(X) is exactly divisible by C(X), can't detect the error
                - Polynomial Division
                    - Representedin binary, do XOR NOT numerical analysis
                    - Hardware - XOR and Shift Gates - can be implemented efficiently
                - Selecting C(X)
                    - All single bit errors, as long as the X^k and x^n terms hve non-zero coefficients
                    - All double bit errors, as long as C(X) contains a factor with at lest three terms
                    - Any odd number of errors, as long as C(x) contains the factor (x+1)
                    - Any burst errors (i.e. sequence of error bits) for which the length of the burst is less than k bits
                    - Most burst errors of larger than k bits can also be detected
        - Acknowledgements and Timeouts
            - Goal - how do we ensure reliability?
            - Protocol - Automatice Repeat Request (ARQ)
                - Stop and Wait
                    - Send Single Frame
                    - Receiver Performs Error Detection
                    - Receiver Does or Does Not Send ACK
                    - No Acknowledgement - Sender Repeats
                    - Acknowledgement - Sender Sends New Frame
                    - Problem - keeping the pipe full
                        - Calc = 1.5Mbps link x 45ms RTT = 67.5kb (8kb
                        - 1 KB frame implies 1/8th link utilization
                        - Volume = RTT x BW - data before 1st bit arrives
                    - Solution - Sliding Window
                - Sliding Window
                     - Allow mulitple outstanding frames
                     - Upper bound outstanding frames called window
                     - Window = number of frames allowed to transmit to fill up the pipe
                     - Window = ( RTT x BW ) / Frame Size
                     - Continue sending frames as ACK are received
                     - Resend frame if missing ACK
                     - Ensure reliability and in order delivery - from sender to receiver
                - Concurent Logical Channels
            - Implementation - Transport Layer by TCP
            - Equivalent for Link - Frame Relay or X.25
            - Situations
                - Frame Received but Ack Corrupted - sender still sends, end up with two copies
                - Frame received but Ack delayed for long enough - sender still sends, end up with two copies
                - Solution - for each frame add a sequence number, drop duplicate frames with same sequence number, alternate 0 1
            
6. 09/28/2022 - Part One
    - Sliding Window Algorithm
        - Goal - allow multiple outstanding (un-ACKed) frames
        - Window - upper bound on un-ACKed frames
    - Idea - ARQ - Automatic Repeat Request
        - Sender is smart enough to determine time to retransmit
        - Acknowledgement - receiver has recieved frame
        - Timeout - wait to send the next frame based on acknowledgement or no acknowledgement
             - How to determine timeout values?
                - RTT - shortest time is when you send and send back i.e. RTT
                - Timeout >= RTT e.g. 2x RTT
    - Stop and Wait
        - Send Frame, Wait for Response
        - Problem - keeping the pipe full
    - Sliding Window - most important algorithm in networking - used in TCP
        - Window - Sending Window Side
        - Estimate for Sending Window Size
            - Desire - fully virtualize network
            - BW x RTT = Volume
            - (BW x RTT) / Frame Size = Senders Window Size
            - (8KB / 1KB) = 8 Frames to transmit
        - Pattern
            - Send SWS
            - For every acknowledgement, you send one frame
        - SW: Sender Parameters
            - Send Window Size
            - Lack Acknowledgement Recieved
            - Last Frame Sent
        - Maintain Invariant - LFS - LAR <= SWS
        - Advance Last Acknowledgement Received by one when ACK arrives
        - Buffer up to SWS Frames, in case you have to retransmit any of the frames
        - SW: Receiver Parameters
            - Received Window Size
            - Largest Acceptable Frame
            - Last Frame Received
            - Invariant - LAF - LFR <= RWS
            - Frame SegNum Arrives
                - If LFR < SegNum <= Last Acceptable Frame - accept
                - If SegNum <= LFR or SegNum > LAF - discard
            - Send cumulative ACKs (Send 0-5)
        - Examples
            - Loss - missed or error detected
        - Scenario - 2RTT
            - Likely to retransmit other frames, even already accepted, waiting for earlier frame to be sent
        - Scenario - DUPACK[1] - means I am waiting for a specific frame
            - Sender immediately resends frame 1 after DUPACK[1], instead of waiting for the timeout
        - If higher ack received, and lower missed, implies lower already received
        - You can group higher ACKs given this, and won't impact performance
        - ACK can be piggy backed on dataframe going other directions, mark as also acknowledgement in the headers
    - Sequence Number Space - Issue
        - SeqNum is finite, and sequence numbers wrap around
        - Sequence number space must be larger than the number fo outstanding frames
        - Example - Four bits, 0-15 and then wrap, 0000 -> 0001 -> ... -> 1111 -> 0000
        - MaxSegNum >= SWS + 1 is not sufficient
        - Example
            - Three Bits - Max Sequence Number is 7 (0 - 7)
            - SWS = 7
            - RWS = 7
            - Sequence Space is 8
            - All frames arrive, but all receiver ACKs are lost
            - Sender waits and repeats with zero frame
            - Receiver already has all frames in order and is expecting next frame to have zero sequence number
            - Next packets should be dropped as they are duplicates, but they will be accepted
        - Rule MaxSeqNum >= 2SWS when Sender Window Size = Receiver Window Size
        - Rule MaxSeqNum = SWS + RWS when Sender Window Size != Receiver Window Size
    - Out of Order Arrival - Possible ABOVE link layer, is issue to be revisited in Ch. 5
    - Achieves
        - Reliability - guaranteed to deliver packet
        - In-order - guaranteedt to be in order
    - Concurrent Logical Channels
        - Multiplex 8 logical chanels over a single link
        - Run stop and wait on each logical channel
        - Maintain three state bits per channel
            - channel busy
            - current sequence number out
            - next sequence number in
        - Header - 3 bit channel num, 1 bit sequence num
            - 4 bits total
            - same as sliding window
        - Separates reliability from order

7. 09/28/2022 - Part Two
    - Shared Access Networks are Different
        - Shared Access Networks assume multiple nodes on the same physical link
            - Bus, ring and wireless structures
            - Transmission sent by one node is received by all others (broadcasting)
            - No intermediate switches
        - Need methods for moderating access (MAC Protocols)
            - Fairness
            - Performance
            - How can this be done?
        - Issue - two nodes transmitting at the same time i.e. collision and signal interference
    - Multiple Access Methods
        - Fixed Assignment
            - Partition channel, circuit switching, so each node gets a slide of the bandwidth
            - Time Division Multiple Access (GSM), Frequency Division Multiple Access, Code Division Multiple Access (3G)
                - CDMA - receiver can filter out results from multiple sources
        - Contention-Based
            - Nodes content equally for bandwidth and recover from collision
            - No assignment and no reservations, when you have data, you transmit
        - Token-Based or Reservation Based
            - Take turns using the channel
            - Whoever holds the object can talk
    - Ethernet
        - History
            - Developed by Xerox PARC in mid 1970s, Metcalfe, meant to share printer among multiple individuals, shared cable
            - Roots in Aloha packet radio network
            - Standardized by DEC, Intel, and Xerox in 1978 (DIX)
            - Similar to IEEE 802.3 standard
            - 802.11 WiFi
            - 802.15 Bluetooth
        - CSMA/CD (Ethernet) - CSMA/CA (Wireless)
            - Carrier Sense - sense in the channel for idle status in order to transmit, cannot avoid collision completely
            - Multiple Access - allow multiple nodes to share cable
            - Collision Detection - detect, while transmitting, for one or more nodes transmitting as well
        - Frame Formats
            - Ethernet DIX - minimum 64 bytesm pad so payload is at least 64 bytes
                - Preamble - 6 Bytes - 010101, sync
                - Destination Address - 6 Bytes 
                - Source Address - 6 Btes
                - Type - 2 (0x0800 IP Datagram) Bytes
                - Payload - 0-1500 Bytes
                - Pad - 0-46 Bytes
                - Check Sum - 4 Bytes
            - IEEE 802.3
                - Preamble
                - SoF
                - DEstination
                - Source
                - Length
                - Data
                - Pad
                - Check-Sum
        - Ethernet Cabling - Manchester Encoding - Need 20Mhz * 50% (Manchester Efficiency) = 10Mbps
            - 10Base - data rate is 10MBps
            - 5 - 500 meters
            - 10Base5 - Thick Coax, vampire tap insecure, can become loose
            - 10Base2 - Thin Coax, uses T connector, more reliable
            - 10Base-T - Twisted Pair
            - 10Base-F - Fiber Optics
        - Ethernet Details
            - Address (Media Acces Control)
                - Unique 48 bit unicast address assigned to each adapter
                - Example - 8:0:2b:34:b1:@
                - Does not change, permanent
                - Broadcast - all 1s
                - Multicase - first bit is 1 - send packet to a group
            - Bandwidth - 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gpbs
                - For all bandwidths, frame format is the same, allowing speed switching between cables
            - Length = <= 2500m (500m segments with 4 repeaters), maximum distance between two nodes 2500m
                - Latency = 51.2 microseconds, maximum latency between two nodes
            - Problem: distributed algorithm that provides fair access
        - Aloha Networks - Wireless
            - Developed in 1960's by Norm Abramson at U of HI for use with packet radio systems
                - Mainframe computers and many terminals
                - Two channels, mainframe to terminals, shared terminal to mainframe channel
                - Any stations can send data at any time
                - Receiver sends an ACK for data
                - Random Backoff - Once collision is detected, randomly wait to retransmit, A wait for 10us and B wait for 30us
            - Slotted Aloha Improvement
                - Divide timeline into multiple slots
                - If you have data ready before the beginning of a slot, you can trasnmit and must only transmit at the beginning of a new slot
                - Random backoff from slots
            - Utilization Aloha - 18%
            - Utilization Slotted Aloha 36%
        - Ethernet Transmit Algorithm
            - Metcalfe analyze Aloha
            - In Aloha, no consideration is given to other nodes activity on channel, difficult with wireless, propogation back is also difficult
            - Ethernet uses CSMA/CD, listen to line before/during sending
            - If line is idle - carrier sense
                - send immediately
                - upper bound message size of 1500 bytes
                - must wait 9.6us between back to back frames, fairness
            - If lines is busy
                - wait until idle and transmit immediately
                - caled 1-persistent (special case of p-persistent)
                - .3 percent, transmit only 30% of the time, 70% don't transmit
            - If collision
                - guaranteed way to detect a collision - make sure the transmit time >= max RTT
                    - So collision returns before you finish transmitting
                    - Frame Size / BW >= max RTT
                    - minimum frame size = maxRTT * BW (EQUATION)
                    - Classic Ethernet
                        - Distance 2500m

        - The link layer cannot guarantee delivery, after 16 tries on ethernet, the packet is discarded
        - Ethernet doesn't guarantee fairness
    - Switched Ethernet
        - Switch - multiple ports - one dedicated link for each device
        - Switch Port - Store and Forward
    - Fast and Gigabit Ethernet
        - Classic Ethernet 10Mbps - Metcalfe
            - Four Twisted Pair
        - Fast 100Mbps - 1990
            - Uses 48/5B - 80% - Clock must be 125 Mhz
            - 1 Pair - Computer to Switch

        - Token Ring Overview
            - Ring of Devices
            - Token - Bit Pattern Rotating
            - To transtmit, token must be retrieved
        - Examples
            - 16Mbps IEEE 802.5
            - 100 Mbps Fiber Distributed Data interface FDDI
        - Idea
            - Frame flows in one detection upstream to downstream
            - You must discard your own frame, once it returns to you
        - Issues
            - If node holding the token crashes, what happens?
            - If transmit frame and you crash, token can circle forever - requiring monitors to manage various aspects of the network
        - FDDI Network - Fiber Distributed Data Interface
            - Dual Fiber Rings for fault tolerance
            - Uses fiber optics instead of cables
        - Timed Token Algorithm (FDDI)
            - Token Holding Time - upper limit on how long a station can hold the token
            - Token Rotation Time - how long it takes the token to traverse the ring
                - Upper Bound - Token Rotation Time = ActiveNodes * Token Holding Time + RingLatency
            - Target Token Rotation Time
                - Agreed upon upper bound on TRT
            - Latencies
                - Ethernet - worst latency is infinite
                - FDDI - maxTRT
            - Scenarios
                - Single Node - THT / THT + Ring Latency - utilizations of network - must wait for rotation before transmitting
                - Token Holding Time - As large as possible to maximize use from a single node

            - Frequency Hopping
                - Transmit over random sequence of frequencies
                - Sender and receiver share pseudorandom number generator and see

            - Nodes can transmit to other nodes within coverage
            - Mesh, communicating what nodes are connected to communicate with each other
            - Routing can be a challenge, links may disappear, requires constant tracking and planning
                - Solution - forward packet based on location, along direction towards target

        - CSMA/CA
            - Carrier Sensing
            - Multiple Access
            - Collision Avoidance
                - Colliison Detection isn't viable, given the difficult of returning the signal back to the sender indicating collision
                - Random back off window i.e. 8 slots, larger number larger wait time
                - Exponential back off occurs as well, 8 -> 16 -> 32
            - Flow
                - ACK confirms received
                - No ACK you can conclude collisions or interference
                - ACK frames have higher priority, frame may be transmitted back, wait post transmission for ACK
        - Hidden Node and Exposed Node
            - Hidden Node
                - C is transmitting to B
                - C's radio range only include B and not A
                - If A wants to send to B, but cant sense C, A thinks B is idle
                - A starts to transmit, interference occurs
                - C's transmission to B will be damaged by A's tranmission to B
            - Exposed Node
                - B wants to transmit to C
                - A is transmitting to B
                - B thinks transmit to C will fail
                - However A-B and B-C can actually be performed in parallel
                - issue - close to transmitter but not receiver and can still actually transmit

                - See CTS - something will be sent and you are closer to reciever so be quiet - HIDDEN NODE
                    - Wait until ACK
                - See RTS but not CTS, ok to transmit - something will be sent, you are not closer to receiver, okay to transmit - EXPOSED NODE
            - Collisions
                - NO CTS predict collision
                - Exponential backoff after detecting a collision
            - Scenario
                - A and B send RTS
                - Exponential Random Backoff
                - A sends RTS
                - Receiver responds with CTS
                - A sends data
                - Receiver sends ACK
            - Key Characteristics
                - Data Frame >> RTS and CTS
                - Data Frame > 1KB
                - RTS and CTS should be transferred at a lower speed and wider coverage, frame smaller but air time is similar

    -  Programming Assignment Two
        - Notes
            - Multiple Clients for Server
                - use select() - manage multiple sockets at once
                - use separate threads for each socket
            - Dealing with recv - which is blocking
                - Recommended is to use the select() function, monitors all four sockets at the same time, in a set
                - server - select() returns will tell you which socket data is ready
                - client - select() returns whether is is the socket or stdin, stdin and socket should be in rdfs
                    - if blocked fgets, then cant handle the server response
            - Working with fd_set
                - FD_ZERO - clear
                - FD_SET - add
                - FD_CLR - remove
                - FD_ISSSET - test
            - What are Pthreads?

            - Why Pthread?
                - Try to realize potential program performance gains
                - Notes
                    - heap and data are shared among the threads
                    - stack is separate for each thread
                    - Must use lock when accesssing shared data i.e. the address book
                    - pthread_create() - run child thread function to manage request -> lock address book -> perform action -> unlock address book
                        - cast input value to void * for function
                    - pthread_exit(return value)
                    - pthread_join() - main function, should we wait?, grab return value
                    - global variable - address book - should be accesible by all the thread funtions defined!!
                    - #include <pthread.h> and g++ -l pthread
                    - maintain list on server side - socket, users logged in, user ID, IP address, port number
                    - exit(), terminates entire process, server side*
            - Shutdown - All clients should be shutdown using broadcast, which means all clients must listen to such broadcast

                - Support large number of hosts, built recurvisely
                - Add new hosts without affecting the performance of existing hosts
        - Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching
            - Circuit Switching - end to end physical circuit, directly connected, low latency, only delays are propogation and link reservation
            - Packet Switching - software, construct packet with source, destination, and data, and hop by hop send it, various delays cause higher latencies, parallel link usage
            - Midterm Exam - Circuit Switching (Constant) vs. Packet Switching (Bursty)

    - Packet Switching Method - Source Routing
        - Source nodes decides how to forward the packet
        - Source 1 says switch 1 forward to port 1
        - Source 1 says switch 2 forward to port 0
        - Source 1 says switch 3 forward to port 3
        - Requires knowledge of all the switches, difficult to implement, impractical
    - Packet Switching Method - Datagram Switching
        - Each packet forwarded independently
        - Each switch maintains a forwarding (routing) table
            - Dest = A - Port = 2
            - Dest = B - Port = 1
            - Dest = C - Port = 3
        - Unicast - individual destination and port
        - Network#
        - Prefix - 141.215.30.222 - 141.215/10
        - Connectionless
        - Used in Network and IP
        - Notes
            - No round trip time delay waiting for connection setup
            - Source hosts has no way of knowing if the network is capable of delivering packet or if dest host i up
            - Possible to route around link and node failures given packets are treated independently
            - Overhead per packet is higher than for connection, given packet must carry full address of the destination
    - Packet Switching Method - Virtual Circuit Switching
        - Explicity connection setup and tear down phase
        - Subsequent packets follow same circuit
        - Connection oriented model
        - Table
            - Incoming Port - 2 
            - Incoming Virtual Circuit Identifier - 5
            - Outgoing Port - 1
            - Outgoing Virtual Circuit Identifier - 11
        - Reserve Bandwidth - up to 64Kbps
        - Guarantee performance
        - Used by ATM - Asynchronous Transfer Model
        - Notes
            - Typically wait full RTT for connection set up
            - Connection request contains full address, each packet contains only a small identifier, making per packet header overhead small
            - If a switch or link in connection fails, connection is broken and a new one needs to be established
            - Connection setup provides an opportunity to reserve resources
    - Creating Switches
        - Optimized for I/O operations
        - Better Design
            - Switch with multiple ports, cross bar design, go directly from input to output without going through shared memory
    - Bridges and Extended LANs - Datagram
        - LANs have physical limitations e.g. 2500m
        - Connect two or more LANs with a bridge
        - Level 2 connection, does not add packet header
        - Accept and forward strategy
        - Learning Bridges
            - Do not forward when unnecessary
            - Maintain forwarding table
                - Manually configured
                - Dynamic
                    - Initially empty table
                    - Learn table entries based on source address
                    - Always forward broadcast frames
                - Table is an optimization, need not be complete
        - Example - Learning Bridge Algorithm - Lecture 08 - 50:00:00
            - Review for Test or HWK #3
            - Abuse - MAC Overflow Attack - Can put any source address, thousands of address, can result in flushing of addresses, control one node and take over all nodes to receive all packets
        - Spanning Tree Algorithm
            - Problem - network forming loops, broadcasts results in packeting forwarding infinitely in loop
            - Solution - take graph and produce spanning tree, spanning tree is a tree that includes all of the vertices of graph G
            - Question - how do you optimally produce a spanning tree?
            - All bridges must participate in construction of spanning tree, distributed
            - Overview
                - Each bridge has a unique id e.g. B1, B2, B3
                - Select bridge with smallest id as root
                - Select Bridge on each LAN closest to root as designated bridge
                - B1 root
                - C uses B2, A uses B5, B3 will be deactivated, no need to use, breaking a loop
                - When tie, select smaller ID, B4, B6 is disabled
            - Details
                - Bridges exchange configuration messages
                    - id for bridge sending the message
                    - id for what the sending brdige believes to be the root bridge
                    - Every bridge says it is the leader, distance 0
                    - Receiving bridge checks, if larger, accept smaller and calculate distance from root
                    - Every bridge learns shortest path to root
                    - Nodes can then select bridge with shortest distance to root as bridge to send message to, disable bridges that have longest path to root
                    - in steady state, only root sends messages
                    - if bridge does not receiev config message, it starts generating config messages to claim root
        - Broadcast and Multicast
            - Forward all broadcast/multicast frames - current practice
            - Learn when no group members downstream
            - Accomplished by having each member of group G send a frame to brdige multicast address with G in source field
        - Limitations of Bridges
            - Does not scale, running algorithm is dificult
            - Issue is transparency when performing broadcast, bridges are known, latency changes through bridges
            - Does not accomodate heterogenity, each node needs to have same package format
    - Asynchronous Transfer Mode: ATM (Network)
        - 1980's-1990's - Standard for High Speed
        - Goal - integrated, end to end transport of carry voice, video, and data
        - ATM - Broadband Integraetd Service Digital Network Architecture
        - Requirements
            - Meeting timing/quality of service requirements of voice, video
            - "Next generation" telephony, roots in telephone world
            - Packet switching (fixed length packets called cells - 58 Bytes - 48B Data, 5B header ) using virtual circuits, mainly just need virtual circuit identifiers
        - Architecture
            - Physical Optical Fiber
            - ATM Network Layer - cell switching and routing

                - data segmentation/reassembly
                - roughly analagous to Internet transport layer
            - Cell Switching

                - VPI - virtual path identifier
            - Service Categories
                - CBR - Constant Bit Rate - T1 circuit
                - Variable Bit Rate - Real Time - real time videoconferencing
                - Variable Bit Rate - Non Real Time - multimedia email
                - ABR - Available Bit Rate - browsing the web
                - Unspecified Bit Rate - background file transfer
            - Virtual Paths
                - Switch maintains per connection information, possibly millions
                - Identifier - 8 bit virtual path identifier + 16 bit virtual circuit identifier 
                - Advantage - the switches in the public network behave as if only one connection
    - Internetworking
        - Goal #1 - scalable, and logn height of the tree is critical
            - Devices - 10^9
        - Goal #2 - interconnect multiple networks together
        - What?
            - An arbitraty collection of networks interconnected to provide some sort of host to host packet delivery service
            - Example - Ethernet, Wireless, Point to Point
        - What is IP?
            - Internet Protocol
            - Key tool used today to build scalable, heterogenous internetworks
            - Add an additional layer between link and transport, called IP
            - Example
                - Hello - TCP Header - IP Header - Wifi Header (over wifi)
                - Hello - TCP Header - IP Header - Ethernet Header (over ethernet)
                - Helo - TCP Headder - IP Header - PPP Headers 
        - IP Service Model
            - Packet Delivery Model
                - Connectionless model for data delivery
                - Best Effort Delivery (unreliable service)
                    - packets are lost - TCP handles
                    - packets are delivered out of order - TCP handles
                    - duplicate copies - TCP handles
                    - packets can be delayed for a long time
                - Global Addressing Scheme
                    - Provide a way to identify all hosts in the network, must be hierarchical
                    - Address - network # and host IP
        - Why is the IP service so simple?
            - Simple, dumb, minimal, faster, more streamlined and lower cost to build and maintain
            - The end to end principle, where possible, implement complex features in end host
            - Allows a variety of reliable or unreliable services to be built on top
            - Workes over any link layer, IP makes very few assumptions about the link layer below
        - IP Service Model Details
            - Tries to prevent packets looping forever
            - Will fragment packets if they are too long
            - Uses a header checksum to reduce changes of delivering datagram to wrong destination
            - Allows for new versions of IP
                - Currently IPv4 with 32 bit addresses
                - IPv6 with 128 bit addresses
            - Allows for new options to be added to header
        - Packet Format
            - Version - 4 bits
            - Header Length - 4 bits
            - Type of Service - 8 bits - 
            - Length - 16 bits - number of bytes in this datagram - 64KB max

            - Flags/Offset - 16 bits - used by fragmentation
            - TTL - Time to Live - 8 bits - number of hops this datagram has traveled
                - Typical path length/network diameter is < 30 nodes
            - Protcol - 8 bits - TCP = 6, UDP = 17
            - Checksum - 16 bits - of the header only

    - IP Service Model
        - IP Fragmentation and Reassembly
            - Each network has some MTU Maximum Transmission Unit
                - Ethernet - 1500 bytes
                - FDDI - 4500 bytes
            - Offset field is used to indicate which fragment of fragmented set, used for ordering
            - Ident, all fragments carry this to indicate they are part of a larger packet
            - Flag - fragmentation or not
                - 0 flag and 0 offset - single packet
            - Reassembly is done at the receiving host
            - Fragments are self contained datagrams with IP headers
            - IP does not recover from missing fragments, if one is lost, all the fragments are thrown away and the packet needs to be resent
            - Each fragment needs to be a multiple of 8
        - Details of IP Fragmentation and Reassembly
            - H1 to R1 - Ethernet 1400 Bytes - MTU is 1500 Bytes - NO FRAGMENTATION
            - R1 to R2 - FDDI - 1400 Byts - MTU is 4500 Bytes - NO FRAGMENTATION
            - R2 to R3 - PPP - Split into 521 Bytes - MTU is 532
                - Fragment 1 - 512 - Offset = 0
                - Fragment 2 - 512 - Offset = 64 x 8 = 512 - UNIT 8
                    - Length is 2^16, Offset is 2^13
                    - To represent length, do 2^13 * 2^3 = 2^16
                - Fragment 3 - 378 - Offset = 128 * 8 = 1024 = 512 * 2
            - R3 to H2
                - What if next MTU is 256?
                    - MTU - 20 = 236
                    - Reduce to multiple of 8
                    - 232 is closest
                - First Fragment - 512
                    - Fragment 1 - 232
                    - Fragment 2 - 232
                    - Fragment 3 is 48
                - Second Fragment
                - Third Fragment
        - Path MTU - Should be lowest MTU on the path - IPv6 - source node should determine this
    - Global Addresses
        - IPv4 Properties
            - Globally Unique - 2^32
            - Hierarchical - network + host ID

                - A - First Bit = 0, Network 7 Bits i.e. 2^7 networks, Host 24 Bits i.e. 2^24 hosts - 16 million
                    - X.Y.Z.A
                    - X is less thatn 128, class A
                - B = First Bit = 1, Second Bit = 0, Network 14 bits i.e. 2^14 networks, Host 16 Bits i.e. 2^16 hosts - 65535
                    - X.Y.Z.A
                    - X is greater than 128 and less than 191, class B
                - C - First Bit = 1, Second Bit = 1, Third Bit = 0, Network 21 bits i.e. 2^21 bits, Host is 8 bits i.e. 2^8 hosts - only 256
            - Issue - Network has 300 hosts, too large for C and too small for B
            - Above - Classful System
            - Current - Classless System - Prefix 2-32 bits
        - IPv4 Dot Notation

            - For every host in the same network, they must share the same network numbers
        - Datagram Forwarding
            - Strategy
                - Every datagram contains destination address
                - If direclty connected to destinations network, then forward to host
                - If not directly connected, forward to some router
                - In each network, there is a default router address to forward out of network
                - Forwarding table maps network number into next hop
                - Each host has a default router
                - Each router maintains a forwarding table
                - Table
                    - Network Number 1, 2, 3, 4
                    - Next Hop R3, R1, Interface 1, Interface 0
        - Address Translation
            - Map IP addresses into physical addresses (MAC)

            - Techniques
                - Encode physical address in host part of IP address
                    - IP Address - Network and Host ID
                        - Issue IPv4 - no size, possible in IPv^6 as Network and Host ID are 64 bits
                        - Issue IPv$ - security concern

                    - IP - 
                    - MAC - 
                    - How to create
                        - Broadcast request if IP address not in table e.g. 141.215.10.30
                        - Target machine responds wth its physical address
                        - Table entries are discarded if not refreshed

                - Source Protocol Address
                - Target Hardware Address - Possible to be all zeroes, or a previously learned MAC address
                - Target Protocol Address
            - ARP Details/Notes
                - Table entries timeout in about 10 minutes
                - Update table with source when you are the target
                - Update table if already have an entry
                - Do not refresh table entries upon reference
    - Host Configuration Protoocl
        - Etherenet address are configured into network by manufacturer and they are unique
        - IP addresses must be unique on a given internetwork, but also must reflect the structure of the internetwork
        - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP
            - Responsible for providing configuration information to hosts
            - At least one DHCP server for an administrative domain
            - DHCP server maintains a pool of available addresses
        - IPconfig
            - IPv4 Address, Lease Time, Default Gateway, DNS Servers, DHCP Server, DNS Servers
        - Most OS provide  way to manually configure the IP information for the host
        - Drawbacks of manual configuration - complexity, prone to errors
        - DHCP Process
            - DISCOVER - Newly booted or attached hosts sends DHCP Discover message to a special IP address (255.255.255.255)
            - OFFER - DHCP relay agent unicast the message to DHCP server and waits for the response or DHCP server receive and unicast
            - REQUEST - Client broadcast request for chosen IP address
            - ACKNOWLEDGE - DHCP server acknowledges and unicasts to client

        - Notes
            - Built on UDP
            - Listening on Port 67
    - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
        - Define a collection of error message that are sent back to the source host whenever a router or host is unable to process an IP datagram successfully
            - Destination host unreachable due to link/node failure
                - IP address is invalid or source host is unactive
                - Network is unreachable, network portion of IP
                - No service listening on the port specified
            - Reassembly process failed
            - TTL had reached 0
            - IP header checksum failed
            - Parameter problem
            - Source quench - slow down on packets sent, not typically used
            - Echo request - ask if machine is alive
            - Echo reply - yes I am alive
            - Timestamp request - same as echo request with timestamp
            - Timestamep reply - same as echo reply with timestampm - accurate measurement of RTT
        - Transport Layer Protocol on top of Internet Protocol, like TCP 6, UDP 17, ICMP 1
        - ICMP Redirect
            - From router to a source host
            - With a better route information
            - Hackers can pretend to perform this redirect to form a man in the middle as a router along the path
        - Tools
            - tracert
                - Send UDP packet, set TTL large
                - If TTL is small, we can trigger router to send ICMP messages back, inside messages we get router information, and can measure round trip time (time exceeded error)
                - Send until you get destination unreachable error, reach host but no service running on that port
            - tracerroute
        - Important: For security reasons, routers can disable ICMP messages (timeout error)

        - Idea, encapsulate IPv6 packet inside of IPv4 packet
    - Virtual Private Networks
        - A Leased Line Private Network - high cost
        - Virtual Private Network - set up tunnels between the sides, when data goes through the network, data is encrypted, nodes must exist in each LAN to perform encryption/decryption and coordination of packets
    - Introduction to Routing
        - Goal - produce forwarding tables, to learn the paths to reach each different network
        - Two Algorithms - Distance Vector Routing and Link State Routing for Intradomain
        - Two Levels of Routing
            - Intradomain
            - Interdomain
        - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (Supernetting)
        - Reduction - Deal with Domain, Deal with Networks, Deal with Hosts
        - Overview
            - Forwarding vs. Routing
                - Forwarding - to select an output port based on destination address and routing table
                - Routing - process by which routing (forwarding) table is built for each router
            - Network as a Graph
                - Problem - find the lowest cost (shortest) path between two nodes
                - Edge - cost, higher bandwidth is smaller cost, greater distance is higher cost
                - Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm - REVIEW
                - Factors
                    - Topology of the network (nodes and connections)
                    - Load in the network
                    - Link failures
                    - Node crashes
                    - Must be a distributed algorithm
        - Distance Vector Routing
            - Each node maintains a set of triplets (Destination, Cost, Next Hop)
            - Exchange updates directly to connected neighbors
            - Example - Table for Node A
                - A sends messsage, learns can reach B, C, E, and F and each costs, sends to all neighbors
                - B sends message, learns can reach A and C and each costs, sends to all neighbors
                - C Sends message, learns can reach A, B, and D and each costs, sends to all neighbors

    - Distance Vector - Distributed Algorithm - Few Hundred/Thousand Networks
        - Exchange entire forwarding tables (destination, cost)
        - When learning something new, update and send to neighbors
        - Issues
            - Infinite loops when links breaks and interleaved updates, integer overflow catches this issue, count to infinity problem
            - Core of the problem - when X tells Y it has a path somewhere, Y has no way o knowing whether itself is on the path, if Y on path, it is a loop
            - Route Information Protocol - RIP - Open Shortest Path Forwarding
            - Solutions
                - Set infinity to maximum distance between two nodes i.e. network diameter
                - Split Horizon - dont allow back sends from specific nodes, i.e. nodes where you have already used it
    - Link State Routing - Few Hundred/Thousand Networks
        - Strategy - send to all node, not just neighbors, information about directly connecetd links - FLOODING
        - Five Parts
            - Discover its neighbors and learn their network addresses
            - Measure the delay or costs to each neighbor
            - Construct a packet telling all it has learned
            - Send packet to all routes
            - Compute the shortest path to every other router
        - Measure Line Costs
            - Echo Packet
            - Round Trip Time divide by two
            - Load e.g. 1/BW - higher bw link is preferred
        - Link State Packet
            - id of the node that created the LSP
            - cost of link to each directly connected neighbor
            - sequence number, only forward when you receive a packet with a new sequence number
            - time to live - how long in the network the packet will be valid
        - Example
            - Network as a Graph
            - Once all link state packets are collected, you can create the graph
            - You can then run shortest path algorithm
        - Reliable Flooding
            - store most recent LSP from each node
            - forward LSP to all nodes but one that sent it
            - generate new LSP periodically
            - start seqno at 0 when reboot
            - decrement TTTL of each stored LSP, discard when TTL = 0
        - Route Calculation
            - Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm - Centralized Algorithm
            - IS-IS - Intermediate System to Intermediate System
            - OSPF
    - Metrics
        - Original ARPANET Metric
            - Measure number of packets enqueued on each link, took neight latency or bandwidth into consideration
        - New ARPANET Metric
            - stamp each incoming packet with its arrival time
            - record departure time
        - Fine Tuning
            - Mulitple a constant binary (1/Bandwidth) - higher the bandwidth, the lower the cost
    - Hierarchical Routing
        - Region
            - One entry for each domain, and then one entry for each network in your own region
        - Route is usually longer, to reach region hops is correct, but within region, unclear of hops needed to find target within network, unoptimal
        - Domains are unlikely to share their internal information
        - Multiple Regions = Zone = Domain + Domain = Bigger Domain
    - How to Make Routing Scale?
        - Flat vs. Hierarchical Address
        - Inefficient use of Hierarchical Address Space
        - Still Too Many Networks
            - Routing table does not scale
            - Route propogation protocols do not scale
        - Use more Hierarchy
            - Host - subnet and host ID
        - Subnetting
            - Add another level to address/routing hierarchy
            - Subnet masks define variable partiion of host part
            - Subnets visible only wihtin site
            - Network Number | Host Number e.g. 141.215 - Network Number = Class B Address
            - Subnetted Address - Network Number | Subnet ID | Host ID
            - Subnet Mask - Which part is subnet ID?
                - Address is 32 bit, if address in subnet is 1, than that is the subnet ID e.g. 255.255.255.0 is 3 bytes 1, so 8*3 = 24 1s which are subnet, 8 zeroes which are host ID
            - 255.255.224.0
                - 11111111 1111111 1100000 00000000
            - Example
                - Host 128.96.34.15
                - Mask 255.255.255.128 - BIT WISE AND
            - Subnet is only internal, outside it is about network numbers
            - Subnet Example
                - Class C Network 210.10.2.0
                - Subnetwork 210.10.2.255
                 - Depts
                    A - 72 hosts - 255.255.255.128
                        - Subnet ID = 0
                        - Range of IP Addresses 210.10.2.0 - 210.10.2.127 - first bit is 0
                    B - 18 hosts - 255.255.255.224
                    C - 35 hosts - 255.255.255.192
                        - Subnet ID = 10
                        - Rang of IP Addressse 210.10.2.128 - 210.10.2.191 - first three bits are 10
                    D - 25 hosts - 255.255.255.224
                    Total - 150 Computers
                - Subnet # - First Address - dont assign to host
        - Classless Addressing
            - Classes Inter Domain Routing CIDR

                    - The growth of backbone routing table as more and more network numbers
                    - Potential exhaustion of the 32 bit address space
                - Address Assignment Efficiency
                    - Arises because of thet IP address structure with class A, B, and C addresses
                    - Forces us to hand out network address space in fixed sized chunks of three very different sizes
            - Size of network, is 2^I, I is 1 to 32
            - Assign blocks of contiguous networks numbers to nearby networks
            - Represent block with a single pair (first_network_address, length)
            - Restrict block size to powers of 2
            - All routers must understand CIDR addressing
            - How does a network get part of IP addr?

                    - Manages DNS
            - Route Aggregation with CIDR
            - IP Forwarding
                - Assumes it can find the network number in a packet and then look up that number in forwarding table
                - We need to change this assumption in case of CIDR, prefixes may be of any length, from 2 to 32 bits
                - It is possible to have prefixes in the forwarding tables that overlap
                    - e.g. find both 171.69 a 16 it prefix and 171.69.10 a 24 bit prefix, so pick the longest one, longest one addresses are contained in the shorter more general prefix
                    - We always want the longest match*

    - Border Gateway Protocol Routing
        - Path Vector Algorithm
            - Indicates complete path (ISPs Autonomous System Numbers) and distance - AS1 -> AS2 -> AS4
        - BGP Example
            - Speaker - advertise information, or cancel previously advertised paths
        - Example
            - A, B, and C are provider networks
            - Preferred path is the cheapest path
            - X,W,Y are customer of provided networks
            - X is dual homed i.e. attached to two networks
            - X does not want to route from B via X to C, so X will not advertise B a route to C
        - Example
            - A advertises to B the path AQ
            - B advertises to X the path BAW
            - Should B advertise to C the path BAW?
                - No, B gets no revenue for routing CBAW since neither W nor C are B's customers
                - B wants to force C to route w viw A
                - B wants to route only to/from its customers
            - Peers do not carry the BLANK traffic
        - BGP Issues
            - AS numbers carried in BGP need to be unique
            - AS numbers are 16 bit numbers assigned by a central authority
            - AS 2 can only recognize itself in the AS path in the example if no other AS identifies in the same way
        - BGP Example
            - AS1, AS2, and AS3 are access ISPS.
            - AS4 and AS5 are regional ISPS
            - AS6 is a Tier 1 ISP
            - What path does a packet from host X to Y take?
            - Money flow is arrow direction
                - Option X -> AS1 -> AS2 -> AS3 -> Y
                    - AS2 no incentive to advertise, they are not paid to transfer to AS3
                - Option X -> AS1 -> AS4 -> AS6 -> AS5 -> AS3 -> Y
                - Option X -> AS1 -> AS4 -> AS5 -> AS3 -> Y - PREFERRED

        - (Endhost) Application Layer - Application Gateway - looks at user data
    - Network Address Translation
        - Goal - allow many hosts to share a single IP address
        - Setup
            - All datagrams leaving local network have same single soruce NAT IP Address: 128.76.29.7, different source port numbers, range shared amonst the host
            - Datagrams with soruce or destination in this network have 10.0.0/24 address for source, destination
        - Motivation - local network uses just one IP address as far as outside world is concerned
            - No need to allocate a range of addresses
            - Can change addresses of devices in local network without notifying outside world
            - Can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network
            - Devices inside local net not explicitly addressable, visible by outside world
        - Private IP Addresses - Source of Local Addresses
            - 65,536 - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - Needs to be mapped to global IP before being addressable
            - 1,048,576 - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
            - 16,777,216 - 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
        - NAT Router Must:
            - Outgoing datagrams - replace source IP address and port# with NAT IP address and new port #
            - Remember in NAT translation table
        - Consequences - difficult to create applications where LAN hosts are clients and servers, given they are inaccessible
        - 16 bit port number field - 60,000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN side address
        - NAT is controversial
            - Routers should only process up to layer 3, port number is layer 4
            - violates end to end argument
            - address shortage shuold instead be solved by IPv6
    - IPv6
        - Initial Motivation - 32 bit address space soon to be completely allocated
            - IPv6 only services and devices, requires assigning an IPv6 and mapping IPv6 to IPv4
            - Header format helps speed processing/forwarding
            - Header changes to faclitate QoS
        - Adoption
            - Increasing slowly - US is ~ 50%, Russia is ~7%
        - Support IPv4 and IPv6 - Dual Stack - two tables
        - Most ISPs are avoiding the work, until the mobile devices, billions of them, come in and push the need for IPv6 addresses
