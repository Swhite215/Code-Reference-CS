                    - Preimage - given a hash value, computationally difficult to find any message that hashes to that value
                    - 2nd Preimage - given an input, computationallly difficult to find another input that hashes to the same value

    - User Authentication - process of verifying an identity claimed by or for a system enttiy
        - Process
            - Present identity
            - Verify identity
        - General Means
            - Somemthing the individual knows e.g. password
            - Something the individual possesses e.g. keyfob
            - Something the individual is (static biometrics) e.g. fingerprint
            - Something the individual does (dynamic biometrics) e.g. voice
        - Weak Authentication
            - Static, guessable, sniffable, vulnerable to dictionary attacks
        - Strong Authentication
            - Prove identity by demonstrating knowledge of a secret known to be associated without revealing anything meaningful
        - Challenge-Response
            - Verifier prompts a challenge
            - Prover generates a cryptographic response specific to the challenge
            - Response
                - Private/public key encyption
                - Integrity mechanism e.g. MAC or hash
                - Digital signatures
        - Private Key or Symmetric Key Based Authentication
            - Protocol 1
                - Alice sends Bob a message "I am Alice"
                - Insecure, Eve can lie
            - Protocol 2
                - Alice sends Bob a message "I am Alice" in an IP Packet containing her source IP address
                - Insecure, Eve can spoof Alice's address
            - Protocol 3
                - Alice sends Bob a message "I am Alice" and sends her secret password
                - Insecure, Eve can intercept and replay later
            - Protocol 4
                - Alice sends Bob a message "I am Alice" and sends her encrypted password
                - Insecure, Eve can sniff packet and playback to Bob
            - Protocol 5
                - Alice sends message, Bob sends Alice a challenge, Alice must return R, encrypted with shared secret key
                - The challenge value must be un-predictable and must not be re-used by Bob
            - Man in the Middle
                - Eve impersonates Bob
                    - Alice to E, I am Alice
                    - Eve to Alice, B's challenge R
                    - Alice responds with Enc(R)
                - Eve Impersonates Alice
                    - Eve to Bob, I am Alice
                    - Bob to Eve, B's challenge R
                    - Eve to Bob, Enc(R) from above
            - Protocol 6
                - Alice to Bob, I am Alice
                - Bob sends challenge with Alice's public key
                - Alice uses symmetric key to encrypt response
                - Alice uses Bob's public key to send encrypted response
                - Bob decrypts response with private key, Bob decrypts response with symmetric key
        - Freshness and Liveness of Authentication Protocols
            - Freshness - message has not been used previously
            - Liveness/Timeliness - message was sent recently i.e. within timeframe
            - Nonce - one time random challenge
                - Requires good source of random numbers that are long and unpredictable and are not re-used
            - Timestamp - include date/timestamp in the message
                - Requires synchronized clocks which is hard in practice
        - Mutual Authentication
            - Previous - unilateral i.e. only Alice authenticated herself to Bob allowing Eve to impersonate Bob
            - Option A - two rounds of unilateral
            - Option B - piggyback to reduce to 3 rounds
                - Reflection Attack - Eve Impersonates B
                    - Alice sends to Eve A Identity and Challenge
                    - Eve initiates separate communication channel with B Identity and A's own challenge back to Alice
                    - Alice sends to Eve Encrypted Response and Value
                    - Eve sends back on the first channel the Encrypted Response and Value
                    - Alice sends back the response
                    - Eve on the second channel sends back the response
                - Solution
                    - Include direction, one key for sending, one key for responding
                    - include direction in response, add target to encrypted value
            - Option C - synchronized clock
                - Alice to Bob, Identity and Encrypted Time and Bob Identity
                - Bob to Alice, Encrypted Time + 1 and Identity
            - Option D - MAC
                - Alice to Bob - Identity and Challegne
                - Bob to Alice - Challenge Response and then HMAC of challenge response, own challenge, and A as target
                - Alice to Bob - HMAC challenge response, challenge response, and B as target

        - Accessibility for Components
            - Components can be public or private
            - Private - accessibly only by components within the same app
            - Public - reachable by other applications
        - Application Signing
            - Developers must sign their application to verify the origin of applications
            - Signature based permissions, applications from same developer share ID
            - Signature is validated at installation time
    - Privilege Escalation Attack and Defense
        - Issues with Security
            - Application Permissions - prevent sensitive data from unauthorized access
            - Issue - relies on user diligence and awareness
            - Permissions are granted all at once and only at installation time
            - Focus, circumvent permissions through permission attacks
        - Privilege Escalation Attack
            - What - application without privilege gets permission through another application
            - Applications A, B, and C
                - Application A is a bad application installed by the user
                - Application A has no granted permissions
                - Application A has CA1 and CA2
                - Application B is granted permission P1
                - Application B has CB1 and CB2, which can be accessed without permissions

                    - Taint Source - mark data with label for sensitivity
                    - Taint Propogation - as tainted data moves, taint tags are propogated
                    - Taint Sink - monitor data to see if it reaches a potentially dangerous sink e.g. file system
                - Limitations - instruction level tracking, performance and granularity is a trade off
            - Tracking
                - Variable level tracking with untrusted application code
                - Message level tracking between applications

                            - Shared to specific STA, used for communication between STA and AP
                        - In practice, only default keys are supported, each STA uses the same shared secret key, in principle STAs can decrypt each other's messages
                    - Default Key
                        - Group key needs to be changed when a member leaves a group, practically impossible to do this simultaneously
                        - WEP supports multiple default keys
                            - One key is active, used for encryption
                            - Any key can be used for decryption
                        - Key Change Process
                            - ABC key used for encryption
                            - AP encrypts with ABC and sends to STA
                            - STA decrypts with ABC
                            - AP generates a new key DEF
                            - New STA joins, AP sends ABC and DEF and says DEF is key
                            - ABC is still active key
                            - STA 1 sends message encrypted with ABC
                            - AP decrypts with ABC
                            - AP sends STA 1 DEF as active key
                            - All STA use DEF as active key
        - WEP Security Flaws
            - Reality - does not achieve any of the design goals...
            - Authentication and Access Control
                - Authentication is one way i..e AP is not authenticated to STA and STA is vulnerable to rogue AP
                - Same shared key is used for both authentication and encryption
                - No session key is established during authentication
                    - Once STA has authenticated and associated to the AP, attacker can send message using MAC address of STA, replay of STA messages is possible
                    - Attacker can compute K with r XOR (r XOR key) after intercepting the message, use K later
            - Integrity and Replay Protection
                - Attacker can manipulate messages despite the ICV mechanism and encryption
                - No replay protection at all because IV is not mandated to be incremented after each message
            - Confidentiality
                - IV resuse - IV space is tool small i..e 16,777,216 possible IVs because of 24 bits
                    - After around 17 million messages, IV reused
                    - IV space is used at about 7 hours if AP at 11Mbs transmits 700 packets per second
                    - In many IVs, IVs are initialized at 0 at startup i.e. devices switched on at nearly same time use same sequence, and with both using default key, IV collisions are readily available
                - Weak RC4 Keys
                    - For some seed values, Rc4 output is not really random
                    - First few bytes of output reveals alot, breaking key is easier
            - Lessons Learned
                - Engineering security protocols is difficult
                    - Strong building blocks combined in the wrong way produce insecure system in the end
                        - Stream ciphers and chalenge response should not be combines
                        - linear message digest function with respect to encryption function makes ICV ineffective
                    - Using an expert in design phase pays out
        - WPA and WPA 2
            - Novelties

                - WiFi Protected Access 2
                - Authentication Model
                    - Supplicant requests access to services (mobile device)
                    - Authenticator controls access to the services (access point)
                    - Authentication Server authorizes access to the services (application on AP or dedicated machine)
                    - Port - logical state implemented in software in the AP
                    - Note - successful authenticatqon results not only in switching port on, but also in a session key between mobile device and authentiacvtion server
                - Extensible Authentication Protocol
                    - Carrier protocol designed to transport messages of authentication protocols
                    - Messages
                        - EAP request - supplication to authentication

            - Cloning
        - Advanced Attacks
            - Relay Attacks
                - Ghost and Leech
                    - Leech, malicious reader, reading info from innocent tag
                    - Ghost, malicious tag, recieves info from the leech and relays it to the good reader
                    - Ghost ends up impersonating the innocent tag to the legitimate reader
                - Reader and Ghost
                    - Malicious reader is the one which the innocent tag intends to make a payment with
                    - Reader relays tag information to Ghost tag, which is sent to legitimate reader for altered purchase
                    - User knows talking with reader
    - Countermeasures for Standard Tags
        - Cover RFID Tags with Mesh/Foil
        - Kill Tags, simple/effeective, eliminates post purchase benefits of RFID for customer e.g. no return, cant always be applied
        - Sleep -  temporarily deactivated, difficult to manage in practice
        - Rename - respond with information unrecognizable, only authorized readers should be able to determine real identifier, tags cannot perform computation
            - Pseudonym - Encryption of Random Number and ID with Key
            - Problems - tracking is possible between operations, pseudonym reused, no reader authentication
        - Proxying (Selective Unlocking) - tags respond

            - RFID Guardian
            - Disadvantages - specialized auxillary device
    - Countermeasures for Crypto Capable Tags
        - Renaming - tags can compute their own pseudonyms, a solution that doesn't scale
            - Reader must try all possible keys until it finds the right one, verification may be too slow
        - Synchronization Approach
            - Counter Value + Key Shared between Tag and Reader
            - Tag responds with it scurernt psuedonym and incremenets counter
            - Reader - matain table with counters, find pseudonym in tables
        - Hash-Chain Based Approach
            - Tag - tag responds with pseudonym and hash of state
            - Forward Secrecy - even if a disposed tag is broken and its current state is determined, previous states cannot be computer
        - Key Tree-Based Approach
            - Tree, unique key is assigned to each tag/leaf
            - Tag contains three keys e.g. K1, K11, K111
            - To identify a tag:
                - Reader issues a challenge
                - Tag uses all keys to generate challenge response (pseudonym)
                - Reader tries all first level keys till one works, then second level, then third level
                - Nice, each time key is identified, reduce next level sub space considerably
                - Worst case, traverse all tags
        - Group Based Approach
            - Tags are divided into groups
            - Tags have group key and unique key
            - To identify a tag:
                - Reader isues a challenge
                - Tag uses unique and group key to generate challenge response (pseudonym)
                - Reader tries all groups, then tries all unique keys
