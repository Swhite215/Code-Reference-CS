            - Adaptive Chosen Plaintext - adversary can choose ciphertexts and obtain corresponding plaintexts
            - Related Key - adversary can obtain ciphertexts, or plaintext-ciphertext pairs produced with different encryption keys
        - Security of Encryption Scheme
            - Secure = computationally infeasible for the adversary to determine the target decryption key
            - Note - for many, no proof of security exists
            - Note - some are provably secure but those are often inefficient

                    - Preimage - given a hash value, computationally difficult to find any message that hashes to that value
                    - 2nd Preimage - given an input, computationallly difficult to find another input that hashes to the same value
