        - Vulnerabilities
            - No physical protection, rather logical association
            - Broadcast nature of communication can be overheard, open participation
            - Subject to eavesdropping, bogus messages, replayed messages, illegitimate acess, denial of service
            - Subject to tracing, resource constraints, physical device insecurity (path)
    - What is Security?
        - Security - protection of assets from potential harm i.e. a vulnerable and valuable asset
        - Information Security - processes and practices used to secure the digital assets you wish to protect
        - Assets - hardware, software, data, resources, services, systems, networks
        - Questions
            - What are you trying to protect?
            - Why are you trying to protect it?
            - What is the value of the asset?
            - What are you protecting it from?
            - What constraints prevent you from protecting the asset?
        - Constraints 
            - Cost, undue impediment, nature of asset
    - General Threat Categories
        - Confidentitality, Integrity and Availability
            - Confidentiality - encryption
                - Secrecy of information i.e. hiding data
                - User privacy i.e. preventing inferrence
            - Integrity - protection from modification
                - Data remains in original form
                - Data has not been manipulated or tampered with
                - Message Authentication Code (MAC) - keyed hash/digest algorithms for data integrity on an insecure network
            - Availability - protection from failure
                - Systems and services are available to users when they need them
                - Systems and services are not withheld by unauthorized means
                - Attack - Denial of Service i.e. jamming e.g TCP SYN flooding
            - +Accountability - users accountable for actions
                - Internal users audit trails, logs, action recording
            - +Repudiation - preventing denial an action has been taken
                - Signatures for nonrepudiation of origin and delivery
        - Authorization and Access Control: AAA
            - Authentication - verify who someone is
            - Authorization - determine what someone can do
            - Accountabiity - record of actions
    - Threats to Wireless and Mobile Devices
        - Data Theft
            - Personally Identifiable Information, Personal Health Information
            - Sniffing - intercept and view wireless signals
            - Malware - control mobile development platform
            - Browser - vulnerable web browsers
            - Wireless Phishing - switch to fake screen for credential input
            - Lost or Stolen Devices
        - Device Control
            - Lily Padding - attacker moves from device to device to get to target
            - Jail Breaking
            - Policy or Device Circumvention
            - Ad-Hoc Connections
            - Endpoint Attacks
            - Bluetooth Hacks - Snarfing
            - NFC and Proximity Hacking
        - System Access
            - Denial of Service Attacks
            - Rogue Access Points - unauthorized access point plugged into a network to create a bypass
            - Evil Twin - access point is set to the same network SSID as a legitimate WLAN or hotspot
    - Risk Mitigation
        - Mobile Devices - locks, password, wipe, GPS location and tracking, data encryption
        - Defense in Depth
            - Physical Controls - doors, locks, cameras, gates, fences
            - Logical/Technical Controls - anti virus, firewalls, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention
            - Administrative Controls - security policies, processes, and procedures
            - Ring of Security - Policies, Physical, Perimeter, LAN, Host, Application
            - Layers
                - External Network Layer - servers exposed to the internet
                - Perimeter Network Layer - between external network layer and internal resources
                - Internal Network - where hosts reside
                - Application Server Network - inner security zone
                - Database Server Network - heart of data, tight security and access policies
