Operating Systems CIS 450

1. 08/31/2022 - Introduction
    - System Basics
        - Hardware - CPU attached to main memory
            - Buses connect components e.g. CPU, memory, graphics, peripheral devices
            - Questions
              - How close should each component be?
              - How do we deal with limited space?
        - Software
            - Questions
                - What happens when a program runs?
                    - It executes instructions, many millions/billions of times every second. The CPU
                        - fetches an instruction from memory
                        - decodes it i.e. figures out which instruction
                        - executes it i.e. does the thing
                        - moves to next instruction F-D-E
                - What else happens in the background when a user program runs?
                    - Body of software, OS Kernel, runs all the time to
                        - make it easy to run programs
                        - allow programs to share memory
                        - enabling programs to interact with devices
        - Basics of Von Nuemann Model of Computing
    - What is an OS?
        - Language, Command Interpreter, Library of Commands, Set of Utilities - NO
        - Definitions
            - Bottom-Up Perspective - Resource Manager
                - Resources - CPU, Memory, Disks, I/O, Timer, Battery, Touch Screens
                - Layers - User -> Application -> Operating System -> Hardware
                - Collection of software that manages computer hardware, intermediary
                - Benefits
                    - Sharing/multiplxing - more that 1 app/user to use resource
                    - Protection of apps from each other
                    - Performance - efficient/fair access to resources
                - Challenges
                    - Managing all kinds of resources
            - Top-Down Perspective - Hardware Abstraction Layer
                - OS as a virtual machine providing a standard library
                - Applications issue system calls to use OS abstractions
                - Benefits
                    - Ease of use
                    - Reusability - provide common functionality
                    - Portablity
                - Challenges
                    - What are the right abstractions?
        - Example - Android
            - Upward Compatability - app developers can write a single app that works across over a billion devices
