Summarization of Content

Chapter 1 - Introduction
    a. Languages, Levels and Virtual Machines
        - Translation - Replace L1 program with L0 program equivalent and then run
        - Interpretation - At exeuction time, replace L1 code with L0 equivalent
    b. Contemporary Multilevel Machines
        - Problem Oriented Language Level - C, C++, Go, Java, Perl, Python, PHP
        - Assembly Language Level- Method to write programs for Levels 1, 2, and 3 translated by assembler
        - Operating System Machine Level - Instructions interpreted by OS and some by the microprogram or hardwired control
        - Instruction Set Architecture - Instructions carried out interpretively by the microprogram or hardware execution circuits
        - Microarchitecture Levels - Registers, ALUs, Data Paths, Microprogram
        - Digital Logical Level - Gates and Boolean Algebra
    c. Evolution of Multilevel Machines
        - Electronic Circuits = Hardware
