    i. Fallacies and Pitfalls
        - P: All exponential laws must come to an end.
        - F: Multiprocessors are a silver bullet.
        - P: Falling prey to Amdahl's Law.
        - P: A single point of failure.
        - F: Hardware enhancements that increase performance also improve energy efficiency, or at worst are energy neutral.
        - F: Benchmarks remain valid indefinitely.
        - F: Disks never fail.
        - F: Peak performance tracks observed performance.
