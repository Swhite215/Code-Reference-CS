Summarization of Content

Chapter 1 - Introduction
    a. What Makes BLE Different
        - Right Technology, Right Compromises, and Right Time
    b. The Specification
        - Bluetooth Core Specification v4.0
    c. Configurations
        - Wirelesss Technologies
            - Classic Bluetooh BR/EDR
                - SPP, RFCOMM, L2CAP, Link Manager, BR/EDR PHY
            - Bluetooth Low Energy BLE
                - GAP, GATTT, SMP, ATT, L2CAP, Link Layer LE PHY
        - Device Types
            - Single Mode BLE, Bluetooth Smart Device
            - Dual-Mode BR/EDR/BLE, Bluetooth Smart Ready Device
        - System on a Chip SOC
            - A single IC runs the application, host, and controller
        - Dual Integrated Circuit IC over Host Controller Interface HCI
            - One IC runs the application and the host and communicates using HCI with a second IC running the controller
        - Dual Integrated Circuit IC with Connectivity Device
            - One IC runs the application and communicates using a proprietary prtocool with a second IC running both the host and the controller
    d. Key Limitations
        - Data Throughput - < .125 Mbit/s or < 125 kbit/s
        - Operating Range - 2 to 5 and possible 30 with line-of-sight
    e. Network Topology
        - Broadcasting - sending data out to any scanning device or receiver in listening range, connectionless
            - Broadcaster - sends nonconnectable advertising packets periodically to anyone willin gto receive them
            - Observer - scans frequencies to receive advertising packets currently being broadcasted
        - Connections - permanent, periodical data exchange of packets between two devices
            - Central (Master) - scans frequencies for connectable advertising packets, and initiates connections. Manages timing and initiates data exchanges
            - Peripheral (Slave) - sends connectable advertising packets and accepts connections. Follows centrals timing and exchnages data regularly
            - Connection Process - Peripheral sends packets, Central picks up and sends request to connect, Peripheral accepts
    f. Protocols versus Profiles
        - Protocol - building blocks to conform to Bluetooth specification, layers that implement packet formats, routing, multiplexing, encoding, and decoding
        - Profiles - "Vertical Slices" of functionality covering either basic modes of operation or specific use cases, define how protocols should be used to achieve goal
            - Generic Profiles
                - Generic Access Profile GAP - Covers the usage model of lower-level radion protocols to define roles, procedures, and modes that allow device to broadcast data, discover devices,
                establish connections, manage connections, and negotiate security levels. Topmost control layer of BLE and mandatory for all BLE devices
                - Generic Attribute Profile GATT - dealing with data exchange in BLE, defines a basic data model and procedure to allow devices to discover, read, write, and push data elements
            - Use-Case-Specific Profiles
                - SIG-Defined GATT Based Profiles
                    - Find Me, Proximity, HID over GATT, Glucose, Health Thermometer, and Cycling Speed and Cadence Profiles
                - Vendor Specific Profiles - Apple iBeacon
