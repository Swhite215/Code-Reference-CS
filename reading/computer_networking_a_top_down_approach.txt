Chapter 5 - The Network Layer: Control Plane
    a. Introduction
        - Control Plane - network-wide logic that controls not only how a datagram is forwarded among routers along an end-to-end path from the source host to the destination host,
        but also how network-layer components and services are configured and managed
        - Methods for Computing Forwarding and Flow Tables
            - Per-Router Control - algorithm runs in each and every router
            - Logically Centralized Control - through SDN controller and network applications 
    b. Routing Algorithms
        - Goal - determine good paths from senders to receivers, through the network of routes
        - Graph - used to formulate routing problems, G = (nodes N, edges E)
        - Path - sequence of nodes connected by edges leading from sender to receiver
        - Least-Cost Path - find a path between between the source and destination that has the least cost
        - Shortest Path - not always the least cost path, it is when all edges have the same cost 
        - Centralized Routing Algorithm - computes the least cost path between source and destination using complete global knowledge of the network
        - Decentralized Routing Algorithm - calculation of least cost path is iterative, occuring at each router
        - Static Routing Algorithms - routes change very slowly over time, often as a resutl of human intervention
        - Dynamic Routing Algorithms - routes change as the network traffic load or topology changes
        - Load Sensitive Algorithm - links cost vary dynamically to reflect the current level of congestion in the underlying link
        - Load Insensitive Algorithm - links cost does not explicitly reflect its current or past level of congestion
        - Link-State Routing Algorithm
            - Network topology and all links costs are known
            - Link-State Broadcast - each node broadcasts link-state packets to all other nodes
        - Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm
            - Iterative, asynchronous, and distributed
            - Each node receives some information from one or more of its directly attached neighbors
    c. Intra-AS Routing in the Internet: OSPF
        - Autonomous System AS - groups of routers under the same administrative control
        - Intra-Autonomous System Routing Protocol - algorithm running within an AS

        - Inter-Autonomous Syste Routing Protocol - coordinate routing between multiple AS
        - Border Gateway Protocol - all ASs run the same inter-AS routing protocol
        - Obtain Prefix reachability Information from Neighboring AS
        - Determing the Best Routes to the Prefixes
        - Advertising BGP Route Information
            - Gateway Router - router on the edge of an AS that directly connects to one or more router in other ASs
            - Internal Router - only connects to hosts and routers within its own AS
        - External BGP Connection - spans two ASs
        - Internal BGP Connection - a BGP sessions betwen routers in the same AS
        - Determining the Best Routes
            - BGP Attributes - prefix with Attributes
            - AS-PATH - list of ASs through which the advertisement has passed
            - NEXT-HOP - IP address of the router interace that begins the AS-PATH
        - Hot Potato Routing - route chosen is the route with the least cost to te NEXT-HOP router
        - Route-Selection Algorithm
            - Route assigned a local preference value as one of its attributes, routes with highest local preference values are selected
            - From remaining routes, route with the shortest AS-PATh is selected
            - From remaining routes, hot potato routing is used
            - If more than one route still remains, router uses BGP identifiers
        - IP-Anycast
            - Used in DNS
            - CDN copnay assigns the asme IP address to each of its servers
            - Use BGP to advertise this IP addres from each of the servers
            - BGP router treats each route advertisements as providing different routes to the same location

        - Data and Control Plane Interaction: An Example
            - Switch1, experiencing link failure, notifies SDN Controller with Port-Status message
            - SDN Controller notifies the link-state manager, which updates a link-state database
            - Network Control Application with Link-State Routing is notified
            - Link-State Routing Application interacts with Link-State Manager to get updated Link-State
            - Link-State Routing Application interacts with Flow Table Manager
            - Flow Table Manager uses OpenFlow protocol to update Flow Table Entries of affected switches
