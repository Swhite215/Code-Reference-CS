        - Nuts and Bolts
            - End Systems

            - Route or Path - Sequence of Communication Links and Packet Switches Traversed by a Packet

            - Internet is infrastructure that provides services to applications
            - Socket Interface - How program on end system asks internet to deliver data to program on another end system
        - What is a Protocol?
            - Defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions
            taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event
    b. The Network Edge
            - Hosts - Clients or Servers
            - Access Networks
                - Network that physically connectes a end system to the first router on a
                path to any other distance end system
            - Home Access - Digital Subscriber Line DSL
                - Obtained from telephone company
                - Telephone line to Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer DSLAM
                - Telephone Line Frequencies - High-Speed Downstream 50 kHz to 1MHz
                - Telephone Line Frequencies - Medium-Speed Upstream Channel 4kHz to 50 kHz
                - Telephone Line Frequencies - Ordinary Two-Way Channel 0 to 4kHz
            - Home Access - Cable
                - Cabel Modem -> Coaxial Cable -> Fiber Node -> Fiber Cable -> Cable Modem Terination System
            - Home Access - Fiber to the Home
                - Optical Network Terminator -> Customer Fiber -> CO Fiber -> Optical Line Terminator
            - Home Access - Satellite and Dial-Up Access
            - Physical Media
                - Physical Medium - Where bit is sent across by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses
                - Physical Medium - Guided or Unguided
                - Twister-Pair Copper Wire - Shielded vs. Unshielded
                - Coaxial Cable
                - Fiber Optics
                - Terrestrial Radio Channels
                - Satellite Radio Channels - Geostationary and Low-Earth Orbiting
    c. The Network Core
        - Packet Switching
            - Messages broken down into chunkcs of data
            - Packets pass through routers/link-layer switches and communication links
            - Store-And-Forward Transmission - Packet switch must receive entire packet before transmissions
            - Queing Delays - Caused by packets collecting in output buffer
            - Packet Loss - Packets are lost when output buffer is full
            - Forwarding Tables - Maps destination addresses to that router's outbound link
            - Routing Protocols - Used to automatically set the forwarding tables
        - Circuit Switching
            - Resources are reserved for the duration of the communication session between end systems
            - Uses dedicated end-to-end connections
            - Multiplexing - Frequency-Division or Time-Division Multiplexing
                - Link dedicates a frequency band for each connection, width is bandwidth
        - Network of Networks
            - Network Structure 1 - All access ISPs connected with a single global transit ISP
            - Network Structure 2 - 100,000s of access ISPs and multiple global ISPs
            - Network Structure 3 - Access ISPs to Regional ISPs to Tier-1 ISPs
            - Network Structure 4 - Points of Presence PoP, Multi-Homing, Peering, and Internet Exchange Points IXPs
            - Network Structure 5 - Content-Provider Networks  - Like Google
    d. Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks
        - Nodal Processig Delay - Time required to examing packets headers and determing where to direct the packet
        - Queuing Delay - Time till entire packet is in output buffer
        - Transmission Delay - Time required to push all of the packet's bits into the link
        - Propogation Delay - Time required to propagate from beginning of link to router
        - Total Delay = Nodal + Queuing + Transmission + Propogation
        - Traffic Intensity - Bits * Average Rate of Packet Arrival to Queue / Transmission Rate La/R
        - Traceroute
        - Throughput - Average = Bits / Transfer Time, Transmission Rate of the Bottleneck Link
    e. Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
        - Layered Architecture - Protocol Layering
        - Application Layer - Network applications and their application-layer protocols reside
        - Transport Layer - Transports application-layer messages between application endpoints
        - Network Layer - Moving datagrams from one host to another TCP/UDP
        - Link Layer - Routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination
        - Physical Layer - Move bits witin the frame from one node to the next
        - OSI - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
        - Encapsuation - Up and Down Encapuslation and Decapsulation
    f. Networks Under Attack
        - Malware - Trojans, Worms, Virus, Botnet, DoS, DDoS, Packet Sniffing, IP Spoofing

        - Proprietary Networks and Internetworking - 1972 - 1980
        - Proliferation of Networks - 1980 - 1990
