Chapter 4 - Logic Functions and Gates
    a. Logic Gate Basics
        - Gate - takes one or more binary signals as input and using a specific algorithm ouputs a single bit as a result
        - NOT Gate - takes a single input and flips the value of the signal
        - AND Gate - produces 1 only if all of its inputs are logic 1
            - Example - A lamp is on if there is power, wall switch, and lamp switch
        - OR Gate - produces 1 if any of its inputs are logic 1
            - Example - A security alarm goes off if door open sensor, or glass break sensor, or motion sensor goes off
        - XOR Gate - produces 1 if number of 1 is odd
    b. Truth Tables
    c. Timing Diagrams for Gates - REVIEW
    d. Combinational Logic
        - Power of logic gates comes when you combine them to create combinational logic
        - Example
            - Door, Glass, Motion sensors into OR Gate
            - Result of OR Gate + Armed into AND Gate
        - Gates
            - NAND GATE, NOR GATE, EXCLUSIVE NOR
    e. Truth Tables for Combinational Logic
        - Start with A, B, C
        - Then Complete Each Step, Using the Appropriate Inputs
        - A Step - B value and NOT Gate
        - B Step - Result of A Step, and A value
        - C Step - Result of B Step and C Value
        - D Step - Result of C and NOT Gate
