        - Circularly Linkied List - nodes of circularly linked list are linked into a circle
            - Cursor - allows use to have a place to strart from if we ever need to traverse a circularly linked list
            - Back - element referenced by the cursor
            - Front - Element immediately following the back
            - Methods - front(), back(), advance(), add(), remove()
                - add() - insert node immediately after the cursor

        - Key Concepts
            - Base case and recursion step
        - Reversing an Array by Recursion

            - Example - revereseArray
        - Binary Recursion - when an algorithm makes two recursive calls e.g. fibonnaci
        - Computing Fibbonaci Numbers via Linear Recursion - MUST REVIEW
