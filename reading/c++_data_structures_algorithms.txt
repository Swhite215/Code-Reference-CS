Chapter 3 - Arrays, Linked Lists, Recursion
    a. Using Arrays
        - Storing Game Entries in an Array
            - Classes
                - Game Entry
                - Scores
                    - GameEntry* entries
            - Insertion
                - When inserting, shift elements right/back, and then insert element at target index
            - Object Removal
                - When removing, start at target index, and shift elements left/forward
        - Sorting an Array
            - Insertion Sort
                - Moving through the array, for each element, sort it into sorted section i.e. start of the array
        - Two Dimensional Arrays and Positional Games
            - C++ - int M[8][10] or int schedule[DAYS][HOURS]
            - Dynamic Allocation of Matrices
                - Pointer to a pointer of integers
                    - int **M = new int*[n]
                    - for int i = 0; i < n; i++
                        - M[i] = new int[m]
        - Using STL Vectors to Implement Matrices
            - vector<vector<int> M(n, vector<int>(m))
    b. Singly Linked Lists
        - Linked List - collection of nodes that together form a linear ordering
        - Node
            - T data, Node* next
        - Implementing a Singly Linked List - CIS 200 - Midterm 2
        - Insertion to the Front of a Singly Linked List - CIS 200 - Midterm 2
        - Removal from the Front of a Singly Linked List - CIS 200 - Midterm 2
        - Implementing a Generic Singly Linked List - CIS 200 - Midterm 2
    c. Doubly Linked Lists
        - Header and Trailer Sentinels - do not store values, header points to first node of the list, trailer points to last node of the list
        - Insertion into a Doubly Linked List - CIS 200 - Lab 07
        - Removal from a Doubly Linked List - CIS 200 - Lab 07
        - A C++ Implementation - CIS 200 - Lab 07
    d. Circularly Linked Lists and List Reversal
        - Circularly Linkied List - nodes of circularly linked list are linked into a circle
            - Cursor - allows use to have a place to strart from if we ever need to traverse a circularly linked list
            - Back - element referenced by the cursor
            - Front - Element immediately following the back
            - Methods - front(), back(), advance(), add(), remove()
                - add() - insert node immediately after the cursor
                - remove() - remove the node immediately after the cursor
            - Example - maintaining a playlist for digital audio player
        - Reversing a Linked List
            - Copy the content of the list L in reverse order into a temporary list T (push into front of T)
            - Copy the contents of T back into L (take from front of T and add to back of L)
    e. Recursion
        - The Factorial Function
        - Ruler Drawing
        - Examples
            - Modern operating system file system directories
            - Argument lists in modern programming languages
            - Russian matryoshka dolls
        - Linear Recursion - function is defined so that it makes at most one recursive call each time it is invoked
            - Linear Sum for Array
        - Key Concepts
            - Base case and recursion step
        - Reversing an Array by Recursion
        - Tail Recursion - uses linear recursion and the algorithm make a recursive call as its very last operation
            - Algorithms that lend themselves more easily and efficicently to conversion to nonrecursive solution
            - Example - revereseArray
        - Binary Recursion - when an algorithm makes two recursive calls e.g. fibonnaci
        - Computing Fibbonaci Numbers via Linear Recursion - MUST REVIEW
        - Multiple Recursion - when a function may make multiple recursive calls, with that number potentially being more than two

Chapter 5 - Stacks, Queues, and Deques
    a. Stacks - container of elements that are inserted and removed according to the last-in-first-out LIFO principle
        - Stack Abstract Data Type
            - Methods - push(), pop(), top(), size(), empty()
        - STL - provides an implementation of a stack based on STL vector class

        - A Simple Array Based Stack Implementation - CIS 200
            - Analysis - each function runs in constant time
        - Imnplementing a Stack with a Generic Lnked List - CIS 200
        - Reversing a Vector Using a Stack
            - Push all the elements of the vector in order into a stack

            - General idea
                - Push opening grouping symbols onto stack
                - If closing group symbol is encountered, check the top of stack and make sure closing matches opening
    b. Queues - container of elements that are inserted and removed according to the first-in-first-out FIFO principle
        - Queue Abstract Data Type
            - Methods - enqueue(), dequeue(), front(), size(), empty()

        - Implementing a Queue with a Circularly Linked List
            - Insert/Enqueue - insert a node new just after the cursor (back), and set new back
            - Remove/Dequeue - remove a node just after the curor (back), and set new front
        - Double Ended Queues (Deque) - queue that supports deletion at both the front and rear of the queue

            - Adapter - data structure, that translates one interface to another
