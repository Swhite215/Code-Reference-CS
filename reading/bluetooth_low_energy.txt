        - Protocol and security algorithms designed to provide the BLE protocol stack with the ability to generate and exchange security keys, which allows peers to communicate
        securely over an encrypted link, to trust the identity of the remote devices, and to hide the pubilc address if required to avoid malicious peers
        - Roles
            - Initiator - always corresponds to the Link Layer master and therefore the GAP central
            - Responder - always corresponds to the Link Layer slave and therefore the GAP peripheral

Chapter 3 - GAP (Advertising and Connections)
    a. Aspects of Device Interaction
        - Roles - imposes restrictions and enforces certain behavioral requirements
        - Modes - state in which the device can switch to for a certain amount of time to achieve a particular goal,
        specifically to allow a peer to perform a particular procedure
        - Procedues - sequence of actions that allows a device to attain a certain goal, associated with mode
        - Security - specify how peers set the level of security required by a particular data exchange, and later
        how that security level is enforced
    b. Roles
        - Broadcaster - transmit-only, distributing advertising packets with data at regular intervals
        - Observer - receive-only, listens for data embedded in advertising packets from broadcasting peers
        - Central - Link Layer Master, capable of establishing multiple connections to peers, intiator of connections
        and allows devices into the network, listens for advertising packets and establishes a connection
        - Peripheral - Link Layer Slave, uses advertising packets to allow centrals to find it and establish a connection
        - Notes - each device can operate in one or more roles at a time
    c. Modes and Procedures
        - Broadcast and Observation
            - Goal - Devices can send data unidirectionally from broadcaster to observer
            - Mode Broadcast to Peer Procedure Observation
        - Discovery Modes
            - Discoverability - how the peripheral advertises its presence to other devices and what those device can
            or should do with that information
            - Non-Discoverable - other devices cannot learn about the presence of a peripheral
            - Limited Discoverable - discoverable for a limited period of time and with a lowered priority
            - General Discoverable - device is discoverable for as long as it is required or deemed necessary
        - Discovery Procedures
            - Limited Discovery Procedure - central starts active scanning with no white list, if LD flag is set, per device
            is reported to the application for further action
            - General Discovery Procedure - central starts active scanning with no white lists, if LD or GD is set, peer devices
            is repoted to the application for further action
        - Connection Establishment Mode
            - Non-Connectable - No advertising packets of ADV_NONCONN_IND or ADV_SCAN_IND APs
            - Directed Connectable - ADV_DIRECT_IND APs at a high frequency and for a short time, with no user data payload
            and with a target central Bluetooth Address

            connectable for a longer period of time
        - Connection Establishment Procedures
            - Auto Connection  - host populates a white list with an array on known peripherals and then instructs the controller
            to connect to the first one detected
            - General Connection - central scans without a white list or APs, for each peripheral detected, application decides
            whether to connect, using a prompt for the user or parsing advertising data, once chosen, direct connection is used
            - Selective Connection - central scans with a white list or APs, for each peripheral detected, application decides
            whether to connect, using a prompt for the user or parsing advertising data, once chosen, direct connection is used
            - Direct Connection - host uses Link Layer to initiate a connection to on single device, identified by its
            Bluetooth Address, without previous knowledge of its presence
        - Additional Procedures
            - Name Discovery - allows a peripheral or central to retrieve the device name over an established connection using
            a GATT transaction
            - Connection Parameter Update - changing connections parameters that are set by the central, either through
            a peripheral request or straight from the central

            the connection to carry sensitive data and to confidently accept the identity of a peer device

            - Static - random number generated either at every device oot or can stay the same for the lifetime of the device
            - Non-Resolvable Private - random number that represents a temporary address used for a certain time
            - Resolvable Private - generated from an Identity Resolving Key IRK and a random number, and can change often
        - Authentication
            - Procedure - enforcing security on the current connection, pairing or re-establishing security using a stored encryption key
            - Qualifier - using an algorithm to create MITM protection during pairing procedure and/or key exchange

                - Level 1 - Unauthenticated Data Signing
                - Level 2 - Authenticated Data Signing
        - Modes and Procedures
            - Non-Bondable Mode - device does not allow a bonding procedure to take place, although pairing procedures can occur
            - Bondable Mode - enables device to create a bond with a peer, permanently storing security keys
            - Bonding Procedure - central can initiate bonding procedure at any time
            - Authentication Procedure - enforces the transition to a security mode on a connection currently in a lower security mode
            - Authorization Procedure - giving user opportunity to reject or accept a particular transaction
            - Encryption Procedure -use Link Layer's encryption capabilities to start the encryption of all traffic over connection
