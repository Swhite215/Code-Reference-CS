1. Database Systems
    a. Data vs. Information
        - Data - raw facts

        - Knowledge - body of information and facts about a specific subject
        - Data Management - discipline that focuses on the proper generation, storage, and retrieval of data
    b. Introducing the Database
        - Database - a shared, integrated computer structure that stores collections of data and metadata
            - Data - raw facts
            - Meta-Data - information about the data
        - Database Management System (DBMS) - collection of programs that manages database structure and controls access to the stored data
        - Role and Advantages of the DBMS
            - Role - intermediary between the user and the database
            - Advantages

                - Increased End-User Productivity
        - Types of Databases
            - Single or Multi-User Databases
            - Workgroup Database < 50 users
            - Enterprise Database > 50 users
            - Centralized Database vs. Decentralized Databases
            - Discipline Specific Database
            - Operational Database - supports businesses day to day
            - Online Transaction Processsing Transactional or Production Database
            - Analytical Databases - focuses primarily on storing historical data and business metrics used exclusively for tactical and strategic decision making
            - Data Warehouse - specialized database that stores data in a format optimized for decisions support
            - Online Analytical Processing OLAP - set of tools that work together to provide advanced data analysis environment
            - Business Intelligence - comprehensive approach to capture and process business data
            - XML Database
            - Social Media
            - NoSQL - describes database systems that are not based on traditional relationship database model
            - Big Data
            - In-Memory
            - Very Large Databases VLD
            - Cloud Databases
        - Types of Data
            - Unstructured - raw state
            - Structured Data - result of formatting unstructured data to facilitate storage, use, and generation of information
            - Semi-structured Data - data already processed to some extent
            - Extensible Markup Language - language used to represent and manipulate data elements
    c. Why Database Design is Important
        - Database Design - activities that focus on the design of the database structure that will be used to store and manage data
    d. Evolution of File System Data Processing
        - Manual File Systems
        - Computerized File Systems
            - Data Processing Specialist
        - File System Redux: Modern End-User Productivity Tools
    e. Problems with File System Data Processing
        - Lengthy Development Time
        - Difficulty of Getting Quick Answers
        - Complex System Administration
        - Lack of Security and Limited Data Sharing
        - Extensive Programmming
        - Structural and Data Dependence
            - Structural Dependence - access to a file is dependent on its structure
            - Data Dependence - access is altered by change of data characteristics
            - Logical Data Format - how the human views the data
            - Physical Data Format - how the computer must work with the data
        - Data Redundancy
            - Islands of Information - scattered data locations
            - Redundancy - same data is stored unnecessarily at different places
            - Issues
                - Poor Data Security
                - Data Inconsistency
                - Anomalies
        - Lack of Design and Data-Modeling
    f. Database Systems
        - System - organization of components that define and regulate the collection, storage, management and use of data within a database environment
        - Components
            - Hardware - physical system devices
            - Software
                - Operating System, Application Programs and Utility Software
            - People
