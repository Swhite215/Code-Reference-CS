Docker Fundamentals
    1. Quick Start
        - Three Innovations
            - Image, Registry, and Container
                - Image - representation of application
                    - Applicaiton, Dependencies, Binaries, Libraries
                - Registry - image/app distribution
                - Container - identical runtime environments
        - Playground - labs.play-with-docker.com
        - Docker System
            - Client
            - Server - Socket, TCP/TLS, SSH Tunnel
        - Major Linux
            - Namespaces, CGroups, VETH, IP Tables, Union Mount
        - Areas
            - Isolation - running multiwple applications on same system and avoiding conflicts
            - Environments - reduced envirnoment variances, contain runs same way with same dependencies 
                - The "Matrix From Hell" Breeds Complexity
            - Speed - develop, build, test, and deploy faster
                - Mainframe to PC
                - Baremetal to Virtual
                - Datacenter to Cloud
                - Host to Container
    2. Course Introduction
    3. Setup
    4. Creating and Using Containers Like a Boss
        - CLI Command Structure
            - docker command
            - docker command sub-command
        - Image vs. Container
            - Image - binary source code
            - Container - running instance
            - Registry - contains images
        - Running a Container
            - Look for image locally in image cache
            - Look in remote image repository
            - Download version
            - Create new container based on image
            - Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
            - Open up port 80 on host and forward to port 80 on container
        - Containers vs Virtual Machines
            - Container - process running on host machines hardware
            - Virtual Machines - virtualized hardware
            - Docker runs lightweight Linux Virtual Machine
        - Assignment Manage Multiple Containers
            - Documentation - docs.docker.com
            - Run nginx, mysql, and httpd, detach and name
        - Container Information
