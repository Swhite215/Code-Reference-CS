Docker Fundamentals
    1. Why Docker, Why Now?
        a. What is Docker?
            - Release 2013
            - System for creating, deploying, and running applications within containers
        b. Why Docker?
            - Containers are the next once in a decade shift in infrastructure
            - Fastest growing cloud enabling technology
            - Docker is all about speed
            - Reduces complexity
        c. What will docker do for me?
            - Develop, build, test, deploy, update, and recover faster
            - Addresses Matrix From Hell...
    2. Types of Docker
        a. Docker CE, Community Edition
        b. Docker EE, Enterprise Edition
        c. Stable, released quarterly
        d. Edge, Beta released monthly
    3. Creating and Using Containers Like a Boss
        a. Image vs. Container
            - Image - binaries and source code that make up the application we want to run
            - Container - running instance of an image
            - Registry - collection of images
        b. Container vs. VM
            - Container - Just processes, limited to what resourecs they can access, exit when process stops
            - Virutal Machine - Software computer that runs an os and applications
        c. What is going on in containers?
            - docker container top - process list in one container
            - docker container inspect - details of one containers config
            - docker container stats - performance statistics
        d. Shell Inside Containers
            - docker container run -it - start new container interactively
            - docker container exec -it - run additional command in existing container
        e. Docker Networks
            - Each container is connected to a private virutal network "bridge"
            - Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
            - All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without -p
            - Things you can do:
                - Make new virtual networks
                - Container attached to more than one virtual network
                - Skip virtul networks and use host IP
            - Bridge, default network
            - Host, skips virtual networking and attaches container to host interface
            - None, interface attached to nothing
            - Security, frontend and backend sit on same docker network, inter-communication never leaves the host
        f. Docker Networks CLI Management
            - docker network ls
            - docker network inspect
            - docker network create --drive
            - docker network connect
            - docker network disconnect
        g. Docker Networks: DNS
            - IP address is not a reliable system
            - DNS Naming, container name is equivalent to host name
            - Within a network, containers are dynamically resolved with DNS names
        h. DNS Round Robin
            - Create a network
            - Create two containers attached to created network, add net alias search
            - Test...?
    4. Docker Images
        a. What is an Image?
            - Is
                - Applications binaries and dependencies
                - Meta data about the image data and how to run the image
                - Official: "An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding exection paramters for use within a container runtime."
                - Can be extremely small
                - Can be large with own ubuntu, apache, php, etc.
            - Is not
                - Not a complete OS, no kernel, kernel modules
        b. Docker Hub Registry
            - Official 
                - Images are high quality images
                - High quality documentation
                - Versions
                    - Referred to by multiple tags
                    - docker pull image:version/tag
            - Alpine
                - A distribution of Linux that is very small
            - Quality
                - Downloads and Stars
        c. Image Layers
            - First layer is scratch
            - Additional changes become new layers
            - Each layer is uniquely identified and only store once on a host
            - Union File System
            - Container = new Read Write Layer on top of an image
            - Copy-On-Write, take file out of image and store copy of file in the image container
        d. Image Tagging
            - Repository (Username or Org/ Repository), Tag based on image id
            -  Publishing
                - docker login
                - docker image tag imageName newImageName
                - docker image push imageName
    5. Building Images
        a. Docker File
            - Composition, each stanza is a layer in the image
                - FROM: required, a minimal distribution to save time and pain
                - ENV: environment variables, main way we set keys and values for container building and running containers
                - RUN: executing shell commands, file edits, zipping, container commands
                    - Chain commands to ensure all commands are a single layer
                - RUN: set up logging correctly to stdout and stderr
                - EXPOSE: by default no tcp or udp ports are open in a container, we expose ports here
                - WORKDIR: change working directory and continue running commands
                - CMD: required parameter, final command that will be run everytime a container is launched or restarted
                - VOLUME: create volume location and assign it to directory
        b. Building
            - docker image build -t customName ., within directory with dockerfile
            - Keep that which changes least at top of dockerfile, and most at the bottom
    6. Volumes: Container Lifetime & Persistent Data
        a. Nature
            - Immutable and ephemeral
            - Immutable infrastructure, never change just re-deploy
            - What about databases or unique data? (Separation of Concerns)
                - This is persistent data that we need to deal with
        b. Volumes
            - Make special location outside of container's union file system to store unique data
            - Persists until manually deleted
            - Options
                - Option #1: Volume command in dockerfile
                - Option #2: CLI named volume -v name:/path
                - Option #3: CLI docker volume create, usually not used...
        c. Bind Mounts
            - Sharing or mounting a host directory inside the container
            - Mapping of the host files, or directories into a container file or directory
            - Basically just two locations pointing to the same file(s)
            - Can't use in a dockerfile, must be in docker run
    7. Docker Compose
        a. docker-compose.yml
            - File filled with multiple containers
            - Structure
                - version: '3.1'
                - services: # containers, same as docker run
                    servicename: # a friendly name, this is also DNS name inside network
                        image: # Optional if you use build:
                        command: # Optional, replace the default CMD specified by the image
                        environment: # Optional, same as -e in docker run
                        volumes: # Optional, same as -v in docker run
                - volumes: # Optional, same as docker volume create
                - networks: # Optional, same as docker network create
        b. docker-compose cli
            - docker-compose up, setup volumes/networks and start all containers
            - docker-compose down, stop all containers and remove cont/vol/net
        c. Using Compose to Build
            - Compose can also build your custom images
    8. Docker Swarm
        a. What is it?
            - Built-In Orchestration: Swarm Mode 2016
            - Clustering solution built inside Docker
            - Not enabled by default
            - Answers
                - How do we automate container lifecycle?
                - How can we easily scale out/in/up/down?
                - How can we ensure our containers are recreated if they fail?
                - How can we replace containers without downtime? (blue/green deploy)
                - How can we control/track where containers get started?
                - How can we cerate cross-node virtual networks?
                - How can we ensure only trusted servers run our containers?
                - How can we store secrets, keys, passwords, and get them to the right container?
        b. How do you use it?
            - Run containers with extra information
                - 1 Service, Multiple Replicas/Tasks - Containers
            - Commands are below
        c. Overlay Multi-Host Networking
            - Creating a swarm wide bridge network where containers can access each other
            - docker network create --drive overlay networkName
            - docker service create --name serviceName --network networkName image (x2)
        d. Scaling Out with Routing Mesh
            - Ingress network that distributes packets for a service to proper task/container
            - Virtual IP load balances across nodes IPs
        e. Stacks: Prduction Grade Compose
            - Stacks accept compose files as their declarative definition for services, networks, and volumes
            - Multiple Services -> Repliaces/Tasks/Containers -> Volumes -> Networks
            - Require v3.x
        f. Swarm Secrets
            - Easiest "secure" solution for storing secrets in Swarm
            - What is a secret?
                - usernames and passwords
                - TLS certificates and keys
                - SSH Keys
                - Any data you want hidden
            - How does it work?
                - Swarm Raft DB is encrypted on disk on Manager nodes
                - Secrets are stored in Swarm and then assigned to Services(s)
                - In-memory file system
                - Create a service and then give the secret to the service, secrets show up as files in the container
            - Secrets with Stacks
                - v3.1 and up is required
                - in docker-compose, add secrets under services and secrets file path
        g. Full- App Life Cycle
            - docker-compose up for development
            - docker-compose up for cli environment
            - docker stack deploy for production environment
        h. Service Updates
            - Provides rolling replacement of tasks/containers in a service
            - Limits downtime
            - Will replace containers for most changes
            - Many cli options to control the update
            - Create options will usually change, adding -d or -rm to them
            - Incldues rollback and healthcheck options
            - Allso has scale and rollback subcommand for quicker access
            - A stack deploy to the same stack is an update
            - Examples
                - docker service update --image myapp:1.2.1 serviceName
                    - update the image used to a newer verison
                - docker service update --env-add NODE_ENV=production --publish-rm 8080
                    - Adding an environment variable and remove a port
                - docker service scale web=8 api=6
                    - Change number of replicas of two services
                - docker stack deploy -c file.yml stackName
        i. Health Checks
            - Available everywhere
            - options
                --interval=, --timeout=, --start-period=, --retries=
            - DOckerfile
                - HEALTHCHECK curl -f http://localhost/ || false
            - States: starting, healthy, or unhealty
            - docker container ls will show the health if health check is running
            - docker container inspect will show last 5 health checks
