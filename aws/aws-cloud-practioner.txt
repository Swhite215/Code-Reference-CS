2. Compute in the Cloud
    - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2
        - Compute As A Service Model
        - Built, installed, secured, and powered compute capacity available for use
        - Multitenancy - sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines
        - Configurations - OS, number, security, disk, software
        - Resizable - Vertical Scaling - Bigger or Smaller
        - Networking - Request, Public, Private
    - Working with EC2
        - Configure and Launch EC2 Instance
        - Connect to EC2 Instance
        - Use EC2 Instance
    - EC2 Instance Types
        - General Purpose
        - Compute Optimized - High Performance Processors
        - Memory Optimized - Fast for Large In-Memory Data Set Work
        - Accelerated Computing - Floating Point Calculations, GPU
        - Storage Optimized - High Performance Sequential Read and Write Access to Large Datasets in Local Storage
    - EC2 Pricing
        - On-Demand - pay for the duration that your instance runs
        - Savings Plans - low prices on EC2 usage based on a 1 or 3 yr term commitment
        - Reserved Instances
            - Standard - you know the EC2 instance type and size
            - Convertible - different availablity zones or instance types
        - Spot Instances - spare 90% Amazon EC2 instances
        - Dedicated Hosts - compliance requirements and sole tenancy
    -  Scaling EC2
        - Scalability - architecture automatically responds to changing demand by scaling in or out
        - EC2 Auto Scaling - automatically add or remove EC2 instances in response to chanig application demand
            - Dynamic Scaling - responds to changing demand
            - Predictive Scaling - schedules number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand
        - Scale Up - more resources to the instances when they are running
        - Scale Out - more instances depending on the workload
    - Directing Traffic with Load Balancing
        - Goal - ensure even distribution of requests to multiple resources
        - Managed Service (Load Balancer) - takes request and routes to appropriate server
            - High performance, cost efficient, scalable, configurable
            - Regional Construct - automatically highly available
            - ELB automatically scales with traffic and changing EC2 instances
            - Front End Single URL ELB redirects to Back Ends
    - Messaging And Queueing
        - Goal - deal with issue between production and subscription
        - Goal - loosely coupled
        - Amazon Simple Queue Services
            - Send, store, and receive messages between any services
            - Payload - data within a payload
        - Amazon Simple Notification Services
            - Send, store, and receive messages between any services
            - Send messages to users
            - Publish, subscribe model
            - Topic - where messages are delivered
            - Subscribers subscribe to topic
            - Publishers send messages to topics
    - Additional Compute Services
        - Serverless - underlying infrastructure is managed by AWS
            - AWS Lambda - upload code to Lambda function, configure trigger, execute code, repeat, 15 minutes, scalable
        - Container Services - Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Kubernetes Service
            - Container - package for your code
            - Registry - store images
