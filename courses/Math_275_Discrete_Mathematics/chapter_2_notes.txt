    a. Sets
        - Introduction
            - Defintion of Set - unordered collection of distinct objects called elemnts or members, a set is said to contain its elements
            - Example - a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A.  
            - Example - The set V of all vowels in the english alphabet can be written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}
            - Example - The set O of odd positive integers less than 10 can be expressed as O = {1,3,5,7,9}
        - Important Sets
            - N = {0,1,2,3,...} - the set of all natural numbers
            - Z = {...., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} - the set of all integers
            - Z+ = {1,2,3,...} - the set of all positive Integers
            - Q = {p/q | p ∈ Z, q ∈ Z, and q != 0} - the set of all rational numbers
            - R - the set of all real numbers
            - R+ - the set of all positive real numbers
            - C - the set of all complex numbers
            - Interval - set of all real numbers between numbers a and b
                - [a,b] = {x | a ≤ x ≤ b} - closed interval
                - [a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b}
                - (a, b] = {x | a < x ≤ b}
                - (a , b) = {x | a < x < b} - open interval
            - {N, Z, Q, R} - set containing four elements, each of which is a set
            - Boolean Set - {0,1} with operators such as AND, OR, and NOT
            - Empty Set - set that has no elemnts i.e. {} or ∅
            - Singleton Set - set with one element {∅}
        - Defintion - Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements i.e. if A and B are sets, ∀x(x ∈ A <-> x ∈ B ) i.e. A = B
            - Example {1,3, 5} = {3,5,1} or {1,3,5} = {1,5,5,5,5,3}
        - Venn Diagrams - graphical representation of sets
            - Universal Set U - contains all the objects under consideration
        - Subsets
            - Definition - set A is a subset of B, and B is a superset of A, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B i.e. A ⊆ B or B ⊇ A
                - ∀x(x ∈ A -> x ∈ B)
            - Proper Subet  - A ⊆ B but A != B, then we say A is a proper subset of B, denoted by A ⊂ B, something belongs to B that does not belong to A
        - Theorem - For every set S
            - ∅ ⊆ S
            - S ⊆ S
        - The Size of a Sets
            - Definition - If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|
            - Example - Let A be the set of odd positive integers less than 10. Than |A| is 5
            - Example - Let S be the set of letters in the English alphabet. Then |S| is 26
            - Example - Because the null set has no elements, it follows that |∅| = 0
            - Definition - A set is said to be infinite if it is not finite e.g. the set of positive integers is infinite
            - Cardinality Equality
                - |I| = infinity and |Q| = infinity, same cardinality
                - Watch out for |R|
        - Definitions
            - Set - unordered collection of distinct objects called elemnets or members, a set is said to contain its elements
            - Set Equality - two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements i.e. if A and B are sets, ∀x(x ∈ A <-> x ∈ B ) i.e. A = B
            - Subset and Superset - set A is a subset of B, and B is a superset of A, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B i.e. A ⊆ B or B ⊇ A
            - Cardinality of a Set - If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S if a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|
        - Power Sets
            - Definition - Given a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P(S)
            - Example - What is the power set of the set {0,1,2}
                - P({0,1,3}) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {0,1,2}}
                - IMPORTANT - the empty set and the set itself are members of this set of subsets
            - Example - What is the power set of the empty set?
                - P(∅) = {∅}
            - Example - What is the power set of the set {∅}?
                - P({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}
        - Cartesian Products
            - Ordered n-tuple (a1, a2, ..., an) is the ordered collection that has a1 as its first element, a2 as its second element, ..., and an as its nth element
            - Definition - Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian Product of A and B, denoted by A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B
                - AxB = {(a,b) | a ∈ A ^ b ∈ B}
            - Example - What is the cartesian product of A = {1,2} and B = {a,b,c}
                - A x B = {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c)}
            - Example - What is the cartesian product of B = {a,b,c} and A = {1,2}
                - B x A = {(a,1), (a,2). (b,1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2)}
            - Example - What is the cartesian product of A = {0,1}, B = {1,2}, and C = {0,1,2}

            - Union Definition - Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B denoted by A ∪ B, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both
                - A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A V x ∈ B}
            - Union Example - The union of the sets {1,3,5} and {1,2,3} is the set {1,2,3,5} i.e. {1,3,5} ∪ {1,2,3} = {1,2,3,5}

            - Complement Definition - Let U be the universal set. The complement of the set A, denoted by A, is the complement of A with respect to U. Therefore the complement of the set A is U - A i.e. what exists in U that does not exist in A
            - Cardinality of the Union of Two Sets
                - |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
                - Example - Let A be the math majors and B the CS majors. To count the number of students who are either math or CS majors, you add math and cs majors and subtract those that are both math and CS
                - Example |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∪ B| - |A ∪ C| - |B ∪ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| 
            - Symmetric Difference - the symmetric difference of A and B denoted by A XOR B is the set A-B U B-A
                - Example
                    - A = {1,2,3,4,5}
                    - B = {4,5,6,7,8}

    c. Functions
        - Introductions
            - Definition - a function f from A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A, we write f(a) = b if b is the unique element of B assigned by the function f to the element a of A, f : A -> B
            - Definition - if f is a function from A to B, we say that A is the domain of f and B is the codomain of f, if f(a) = b, we say that b is the image of a and a is the preimage of b. The range, or image, of f is the set of all images of elements of A. f maps A to B
                - image - f(a) = b, b is image
                - preimage - f(a) = b, a is preimage
                - range of f - set of of all images of elements of A
        - One to One Functions
            - Definition - a function is said to be one-to-one, or an injection, if and only if f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of 
            - Definition - a function from A to B is called onto, or a surjection, if and only if for every element b ∈ B there is an element a ∈ A with f(a) = b.
                - For every B, there is an element a that produces it
                - Example - f(x) = x^2, no, there is no integer where x^2 = -1, etc negative numbers
            - Definition - a function is one-to-one correspondence or a bijection if it is both one-to-one and onto, all values for B and only one to one
            - Suppose f: A -> B
                - To show that f is injective, show that if f(x) = f(y) for arbitrary x, y ∈ A, then x = y (Each unique x value produces a unique y value)
                - To show that f is not injective, find particular elements x, y ∈ A, such that x != y and f(x) = f(y) (At least two different x values must produce the same y value)
                - To show that f is surjective - consider an arbitrary element y ∈ B and find an element x ∈ A such that f(x) = y (Every value in the codomain must be produced by inputting an element from the domain into the function)
                - To show that f is not surjective - find a particular y ∈ B such that f(x) != y for all x ∈ A (Find a value in the codomain that is not produced by inputting a value in the domain into the function)
            - Definition - Let f be a one-to-one correspondence from the set A to the set B, the inverse function of F is the function that assigns to an element b belonging to B the unique element of a in A such that f(a) = b . The inverse function of f is denoted by f^-1. Hence f^-1(b) = 1 when f(a) = b
                - Example - f: Z -> Z such that f(x) = x + 1, invertible f^-1(y) = y - 1
            - Definition - Let g be a function from the sedt A to the set B and let f be a function from the set B to the set C, the composition of the functions f and g denoted fro all a ∈ A by fog, is the function from A to C defined by (fog)(a) = f(g(a))
        - Some Important Functions
            - Definition - the floor function assigns to the real number x the largest integer that is less than or equal to x. The value of the floor function at x is denoted by ⌊x⌋
            - Definition - the ceiling function assigns to the real number x the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x. The value of the ceiling function at x is denoted by ⌈x⌉
                - Floor of 1/2 is 0 and Celing of 1/2 is 1
                - Floor of -1/2 is -1 and Ceiling of -1/2 is 0
                - Floor of 3.1 is 3 and Ceiling of 3.1 is 4
                - Floor of 7 is 7 and Ceiling of 7 is 7
                - Example - Byte is 8 bits, how many bytes required to encode 100 bits of data - CEILING of 100/8 = 12.5 = 13

    d. Sequences and Summations
        - Sequences
            - Definition - a sequence is a function from a subset of the integers (usually either the set {0,1,2,...} or the set {1,2,3,...} to a set S. We use the notation An to denote the image of the integer n. We call an a term of the sequence
                - Example - {an} where an = 1/n is {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5}
            - Definition - a geometric progression is a sequence of the form a, ar, ar^2,...,ar^n,... where the initial term a and the common ration r are real numbers
                - Example - {bn} where bn = (-1)^n
                - Example - {cn} where cn = 2*(5)^n
                - Example - {dn} where dn = 6*(1/3)^n
            - Definition - an arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form a, a +d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ..., a + nd, ... where the initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers
        - Recurrence Relations
            - Definition - a recurrence relation for the sequence {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence, namely, a0, a1, a2, an-1 for all integers n with n >= n0 where n0 is a nonnegative integer.
            - Definition - a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation, a recurrence relation is said to recursively define a sequence
                - Example - let {an} be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation an = an-1 + 3 for n = 1,2,3,... and suppose that a0 = 2. What are a1, a2, and a3
                    - a1 = a0 + 3 = 5
                    - a2 = a1 + 3 = 8
                    - a3 = a2 + 3 = 11
                - Example - let {an} be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation an = an-1 - an-2 for n = 2, 3, 4 and suppose that a0 = 3 and a1 = 5. What are a2 and a3?
                    - a2 = a1 - a0 = 5 - 3 = 2
                    - a3 = a2 - a1 = 2 - 5 = -3
            - Initial Condition - for a recursively defined sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect, using mathematical induction, a proof technique introduced in chapter 5, it can be shown that a recurrence relation together with its initial condition determines a unique solution
                - Example - Fibonnaci Sequencee - fn = fn-1 + fn-2 where fo = 1 and f1 = 1
                    - f2 = f1 + f0 = 1 + 1 = 2
                    - f3 = f2 + f1 = 2 + 1 = 3
                    - f4 = f3 + f2 = 5
                    - f5 = f4 + f3 = 8
