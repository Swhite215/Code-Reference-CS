2. Resources and Access in the Cloud
    - Google Cloud Resource Hierarchy
        - Org Node -> Folders -> Projects -> Resources
        - Project
            - Separate entities under the Org node
            - Hold resources, each of which belongs to just one project
            - Can have different owners and users
            - Billed separately
            - Project ID - globally unique, assigned, immutable
            - Name - not unique, chosen by you, mutable
            - Project Number - globally unique, assigned, immutable
        - Resource Manager - manages projects
            - Gather a list of projects
            - Create new projects
            - Update existing projects
            - Delete projects
            - Recover previouslyu deleted projects
            - Access through RPC API or REST API
        - Folder - contains resources
            - The resources inherit policies and permissions assigned to folders
            - Group projects together
        - Organziation Node/Roles
            - Policy Administration - super user for the whole of the organization
            - Project Creator
            - New Organization
                - Google Workspace Customer - projects will automatically belong to your org node
                - Non-Google Workspace - use cloud identity to create organization node
        - Policies - who can do what, access is granted
            - Organization Node Policy
    - Identity and Access Management
        - Big Idea - who can do what on which resources
        - Policies are managed and applied by IAM
    - IAM Roles
        - Basic - broad in scope, basic viewer, editor
        - Predefined - match job needs e.g. instanceAdmin, about 1,300, bundled permissions
        - Custom - name, description, id, and permissions
    - Service Accounts
        - Applications that need to communicate with other services or applications e.g. virtual machine communicating with cloud storage
        - Identity applied to resource as a service account, and permissions can be applied to service accounts
    - Cloud Identity (Google not GCP)
        - Manages team and organization access
        - Gmail Account -> Google Cloud Consoles -> Google Groups
    - Interaction with Google Cloud

            - Segments networks
            - Globally unique and have subnets in any Google Cloud region worldwide
            - VPC subnets connect resources in different zones
            - Uses firewall to restrict access to instances
            - Creates static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations
    - Compute Engine
        - Virtual Machines

            - Committed Use - commit to using a specific amount of resources for a specific amount of time
            - Spot VMs - 80-90% discount, VM might not be available and can be taken away from you at anytime
                - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-use-preemptible#best_practices
                - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-use-spot#best-practices
            - Pay for only what you need, use, want
    - Scaling Virtual Machines
        - Auto-Scaling - multi-dimensional scaling based on multiple metrics
    - Important VPC Capabilities
        - VPCs do not require a router to be provisioned
        - Routing Tables
            - Built in so you dont have to provision or manage a router
            - Used to forward traffic from one instance to another
        - VPCs do not require a firewall to be provisioned
        - VPC Firewall
            - Restricts access to instances through both incoming and outgoing traffic
            - Rules be defined through network tags on Compute Engine instances
        - VPC Peering - VMs in different VPCs communicate using internal IPs
        - Shared VPC - VMs in other projects can join VPC in another project
    - Cloud Load Balancing
        - Load balancing distributes traffic across instances
        - Cloud Load Balancing
            - Full distributed, software-defined, managed service
            - HTTP, TCP, SSL, UDP, Proxy, Regional, Regional Internal
            - Provides single as well as cross region load balancing, including automatic multi-region failover
            - No pre-warming is required for anticipated spikes in traffic
            - Internal vs. External
    - Cloud Domain Name Service
        - Public DNS Service - 8.8.8.8
    - Cloud Content Delivery Network
    - Connecting Networks to Google VPC
        - Cloud VPN
            - IPSec VPN Protocol
                - Creates a VPN tunnel connection
                - Use Cloud Router to make the connection dynamic
                - Let others network and Google VPC exchange route information over the VPN using the Border Gateway Protocol
                - Not always the best option because of security concerns or bandwidth reliability
                - Small number of MBs
            - Dedicated Interconect
                - Good solution for getting highest uptimes for interconnection
                - Allows for one or more direct private connections to Google
                - 99.99% SLA
                - Connections can be backed up by a VPN for even greater reliability
                - More MBs than IPSec VPN
            - Partner Interconnecxt
                - ISP links your on-prem with your VPC
                - Can be configured to suppor tmission criticl services or applications that can tolerate some downtime
                - Small number of MBs
                - 99.99% SLA
            - Direct Peering
                - Puts a router in the same public datacenter as a Google Point of Presence
                - Uses a router to exchange traffic between networks
                - Connects to more than 100 Google points of presence around the world
            - Carrier Peering
                - ISP
    - Lab - Getting Started with VPC Networking and Google Compute Engine
        - Notes
            - Make sure you create the firewall rules
            - Allow internal -> Allow custom firewall rule
            - Routes do not appear to disappear, refresh the page
            - Don't confuse SSH terminals with Cloud Shell
