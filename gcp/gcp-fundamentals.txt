Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

1. Introducing Google Cloud
    - Overview of Cloud Computing
    - IaaS and PaaS and Saas
        - Infrastructure as a Service
        - Platform as a Service
        - Software as a Service
    - The Google Cloud Network
        - Features
            - Designed for High Throughput
        - Infrastructure Locations
            - North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Austrailia
            - https://cloud.google.com/about/locations
        - Location -> Multiple Regions -> Multiple Zones
        - Europe - europe-west2 -> europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c
        - Note - some services can run in multiple geographic locations
        - Current Numbers - 112 Zones, 37 Regions 04/10/2023
    - Environmental Impact
        - Commitment 
            - Carbon Neutral, Renewable Energy, Carbon Free
    - Security
        - GCP - designed with security in mind
        - Layered Approach
            - Hardware Layer
                - Hardware Design and Provenance
                - Secure Boot Stack - ensure booting correct software stack
                - Premises Security - multiple layers of physical security protections
            - Service Deployment
                - Encryption of inter-service communication
            - User Identity Level
                - Universal Two-Factor Authentication
                - Zero Trust Model
            - Storage Service Level
                - Encryption at Rest
                - Hard Drives and SSDs Hardware Encryption
            - Internet Communication Level
                - Google Front End - all registered services use TLS
                - Denial of Service Protection - multi-tier, multi-layer DoS protections
            - Operational Security Level
                - Intrustion Detection
                - Reducing Insider Risk
                - Employee Universal Second Factor
                - Software Development Practices
            - https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/infrastructure/design
    - Open APIs and Open Source
        - Open-Source Friendly
        - Examples
            - TensorFlow - open source library for machine learning
            - Kubernetes - container orchestration
            - Google Cloud's Operation Suite
    - Pricing and Billing
        - Types
            - Google Compute Products - billed per second (after 1st minute)
            - Sustained Use Discount - use resource a dedicated amount results in a discount
            - Committed Use Discount
            - Custom Virtual Machine Types
        - Google Cloud Pricing Calculator
        - Billing Tools - Budgets, Alerts, Reports, Quotas (Hard Limits)
            - Rate Quota - resets after a specific time
            - Allocation Quota - govern number of resources in a project
