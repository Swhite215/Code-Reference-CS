GCP For Beginners - Becomer a Google CLoud Digital Leader

1. Introduction to GCP
    - Challenges
        - High cost of procuring infrastructure
        - Ahead of time planning
        _ Low infrastructure utilization
        - Dedicated infrastructure team
    - Solution/Benefits
        - On-demand resource provisioning or elasticity
        - Trade captial expense for variable expense
        - Benefit from massive economies of scale
    - Google Cloud Platform
        - One of top three cloud providers
        - 200+ services
        - Relibale, secure, and highly performant

2. Regions and Zones
    - Challenge
        - Providing low latency
        - Enabling high availability
        - Adhering to regulations
    - Solution
        - Regions - 20+ - specific geographic location to host your resources
        - Zones - achieving high availability in a specific region, increased fault tolerance
            - Cluster - distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data region

3. Compute Engine, Instance Groups, and Load Balancing
    - Compute Engine - Provision and Manage Virtual Machines
        - Create and manage lifecycle of VMs
        - Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances
        - Attach storage to your VM instances
        - Manage network connectivity and configuration for VM instances
    - IP Addresses
        - Internal - permanent internal IP address that does not change during the lifetime of an instance
        - External - IP address that changes when an instance is stopped
        - Static - permanent external IP address that is associated with an instance
    - Quick Setup
        - Start-Up Script
            - Bootstrapping - install OS patches or software when a VM is launched
            - Management -> Startup Script
        - Instance Templates
            - Define machine type, images, labels, startup script, and other properties
            - Can be used for managed instance groups
            - CANNOT be updated
            - Virtual Machines -> Instance Templates
        - Custom Image
            - Customize images to your corporate security standards - hardened
            - Use over start up to reduce boot up time
            - Storage Disks -> Disk -> Actions -> Create Image
    - Sustained Use Discounts
        - Automatic discounts for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month
        - Discount increases with usage
        - Applicable for Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine
        - Does not apply to certain machines or App Engine Flexible and Dataflow VMs
    - Committed Use Discounts
        - For workloads with predictable resource needs e.g. VM for 1-3 years
        - Higher discount than sustained use discount
        - You cannot cancel commitments
    - Preemptible Virutal Machines
        - Short lived cheap compute instances
        - Maximum runtime of 24 hours
        - Instances get 30 seconds warning before being stopped
        - Use
            - Application is fault tolerant
            - You are cost sensitive
            - Your workload is not immediate e.g. batch processing
        - Not always available
        - No SLA
        - Cannot be migrated to regualr VMs
        - No automatic restarts
    - Spot VMs - latest version of preemptible VMs
        - Does not have a maximum runtime
    - Sole Tenant Nodes
        - Default is Shared Tenancy - Single host machine can have instances from multiple customers
        - Virtualized instances on hardware are dedicated to one customer
        - Sole-Tenant Nodes -> Create a Node Group -> Label and VM Instance -> Sole Tenancy -> Node Affinity Label
        - Security and Compliance Requirements
        - High Performance Requirements
        - Licensing Requirements
    - Custom Machine Types
        - Adjust vCPUs, memory, and GPUs
        - Choose between E2, N2, or N1
        - Billed per vCPUs and memory provisioned
        - VM Instances -> Machine Type -> Custom
    - Primary Costs
        - Infrastructure Costs - CPUs, RAM, Disks
        - Licensing Costs - Operating Systems
            - Options
                - Pay as you go - PAYG
                - Use existing license - BYOS or BYOL
    - Instance Groups
        - Group of VM instances managed by a single entity
        - Types
            - Managed - identical VMs created using a template
                - Features: auto scaling, auto healing, and managed releases
            - Unmanaged - different configuration for VMs in same group
                - None of the managed features
        - Location can be Zonal or Regional
        - Managed Instance Groups
            - Identical VMs created using an instance template
            - Maintain certain number of instances
            - Detect application failures using health checks
            - Increase and descrease instances based on load
            - Add load balancer to distribute load
            - Release new application versions without downtime
            - Rolling updates
            - Canary Deployment - test new version with a group of instances before releasing it across all instances
    - Creating Managed Instance Group
        - Create instance template
        - Configure auto scaling, min/max instances and autoscaling metrics, cool down, scale in control, auto healing
    - Load Balancing
        - Distribute traffic across VM instances in one or more regions - global
        - Managed Service
            - Google Cloud ensures it is highly available
            - Auto scales to handle huge loads

            - TCP Proxy
            - External Network TCP/UDP
