Fundamentals of Computer Storage
    1. Overview
        a. Primary Storage
            - Memory (RAM)
        b. Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile)
            - Optical
                - CD, DVD, Blu-Ray
            - Magnetic
            - Solid State Storage
            - Hard Disk Drive
                - Platters with Read/Write Heads reading + and - charges
            - Tape Storage, Archival
        c. Ways of Storing
            - Direct Access
            - Sequential Access
        d. Location
            - Internal
            - External
            - Remote, Mirrored
    2. HDD & File Systems
        a. HDD
            - Magnetic Storage
            - Read/Write Head aligns magnetic particles in one of two ways as it moves across disk surface
            - Components
                - Spindle, Platters, Read/Write Head, Actuator Arm, Actuator Axis, Actuator
                - Power Connector, SATA Connector, Jumper
            - Internal and External Hard Drives
            - Head Crash - Read/Write Head hits platter, causing an issue
            - Logical vs. Physical File Representation
                - Logical - One Platter Cylinder
                - Physical - Multiple Platters
            - Tracks - Data is stored on circular tracks
            - Sector - Disk is divided into pie-shaped sectors 
            - Cluster - The part of track that crosses two ore more adjacent sectors, smalles addressable unit of disk storage
            - File System - Attached to one or many clusters (File Allocation Table or New Technology File System)
            - Fragmentation & Defragmentation
                - Fragmentation - Files stored all over the place
                - Defragmentation - Files stored in consecutive/less clusters
    3. Optical Storage
        a. Overview
            - Uses light to store information
            - Direct access
            - Track - Single grooved track spirals from the center of the disc outward, recorded datat is stored in groove
            - Sector - Track is divided into multiple sectors for data organization
            - Writing Data - Laser beam creates datk, nonreflective areas on the disk to function as pits
            - Reading Data - Low intensity laser beam reads the disc, transitions between the pits and lands represent the 1s, the length of time between transitions represent the 0s
        b. Examples
            - DVD
            - Blu-Ray
            - CD
            - ROM, R, RW
    4. Solid State Storage
        a. Overview
            - Flash Memory
            - Transistors - Transmit and Resist
            - Silicon - Semiconductor material, doesn't really conduct or insulate
                - N-Type, silicon gains extra electtrons, so electrons flow out of it more naturally
                - P-Type, silicon loses electrons, so electrons in nearby materials will tend to flow into it
                - Sandwich, junction or depletion zone where N-Type and P-Type come together, doesn't conduct electricity
                - Add electricity, electrons get pushed across junction or depletion zone
                - LED, Light Emitting Diode that emits light when current flows through it
            - NPN Transistor
            - PNP Transistor
            - Bipolar - Two charges needed
            - Unipolar - One charge needed
