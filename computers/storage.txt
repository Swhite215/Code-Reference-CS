Fundamentals of Computer Storage
    1. Overview
        a. Primary Storage
            - Memory (RAM)
        b. Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile)
            - Optical
                - CD, DVD, Blu-Ray
            - Magnetic
            - Solid State Storage
            - Hard Disk Drive
                - Platters with Read/Write Heads reading + and - charges
            - Tape Storage, Archival
        c. Ways of Storing
            - Direct Access
            - Sequential Access
        d. Location
            - Internal
            - External
            - Remote, Mirrored
    2. HDD & File Systems
        a. HDD
            - Magnetic Storage
            - Read/Write Head aligns magnetic particles in one of two ways as it moves across disk surface
            - Components
                - Spindle, Platters, Read/Write Head, Actuator Arm, Actuator Axis, Actuator
                - Power Connector, SATA Connector, Jumper
            - Internal and External Hard Drives
            - Head Crash - Read/Write Head hits platter, causing an issue
            - Logical vs. Physical File Representation
                - Logical - One Platter Cylinder
                - Physical - Multiple Platters
            - Tracks - Data is stored on circular tracks
            - Sector - Disk is divided into pie-shaped sectors 
            - Cluster - The part of track that crosses two ore more adjacent sectors, smalles addressable unit of disk storage
            - File System - Attached to one or many clusters (File Allocation Table or New Technology File System)
            - Fragmentation & Defragmentation
                - Fragmentation - Files stored all over the place
                - Defragmentation - Files stored in consecutive/less clusters
