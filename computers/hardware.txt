                - Need Brand and Model Number
            - Primary Storage
        i. CPU - Central Processing Unit
            - Carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specificed by the instructions
            - Components
                - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that perforsm arithmetic and logic operations
                - Process Registers that supply operands to the ALU and store ALU operations results
