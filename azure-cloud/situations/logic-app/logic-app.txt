Objectives:
    1. Create a multi-activity workflow
    2. Handle exceptions thrown during app execution

Important Information:
    1. Logic App
        - Event-driven serverless system to implement long running business workflows
    2. Components of Solution
        - Storage Account w/ Queue and Blob Container
        - Logic App
        - Error Handling
            - Retry Policies
                - Default - sends up to four retries at exponentially increasing intervals, which scale by 7.5 seconds but are capped between 5 and 45 seconds
                - Exponential Interval - waits a random interval selected from an exponentially growing range before sending the next request
                - Fixed Interval - waits the specificed interval before sending the next request
                - None - does not resend the request
    3. Order of Operations
        - Create Storage Account
        - Create Logic App + Configure
        - Logic App Designer - + Blank Logic App
        - Logic App Design Service - Start (Schedule)
        - + Step to Add Action - Variables (Initialize)
        - + Step to Add Action - Azure Blob Storage (List All Blobs)
        - + Step to Add Action - Control (For Each)
            - + Add Action - Control (Conditional)
                - if true - + Add Action Azure Queues (Put a Message on a Queue)
                    - Ellipses - Retry Policy - (Default, Exponential, Fixed, None)
    4. Exam Essentials
        - Construct a multi-activity workflow
        - Retry policies
        - Understand Logic App JSON
        - Contrast Logic Apps, Function Apps, WebJobs, and Flow
            - Logic Apps - declarative event driven system that integrates with other services
            - Functions are light-weight and code first
            - Queue Messages - Functions
            - DevOps - WebJobs can run alongside Web Apps in same devops environment
