Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate

Serverless Applications in Microsoft Azure

    1. Module 1: Choosing the Best Azure Service to Automate Business Process
        a. Identify the Technology Options
            - Workflow Tools - Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, WebJobs, and Azure Functions
            - Inputs, Actions - Simple executed operations, Conditions, Outputs
            - Logic Apps - automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components
                - Connector - Logic Apps component that provides an interface to an external service
            - Microsoft Flow - service to create workflows
                - Flows - automated, button, scheduled, business process
            - WebJobs - part of Azure App Service that you can use to run a program automatically
                - Continuous - looping, Triggered - manually started
            - Azure Functions
                - Templates - HTTPTrigger, TimerTrigger, BlobTrigger, CosmosDBTrigger
        b. Analyze the Decision Criteria
            - Design First vs. Code First
            - Integration vs. Brand New
            - User vs. Business vs. Developer
        c. Best Technology to Automate Business Needs
        d. When to Choose Azure Functions
            - Code-First and As Needed Use/Payment and Integrations with Logic Apps
    
    2. Module 2: Create Serveless Logic with Azure Functions
        a. Is Serverless Computing Right for You?
            - Serverless Compute - function-as-a-service FaaS
            - Azure Functions - serverless application platform
            - Benefits
                - Automatic Scaling, Language of Your Choice, No Servers to Manage, Only Charged on Use
            - Good For
                - Stateless Logic, Event Driven
            - Drawbacks
                - Timeout of 5 - 10 Minutes, HTTP Timeout of 7.5 - 12.5 Minutes
                - Execution Frequency
        b. Create a Function App in Azure Portal
            - Function App - Execution Context for Azure Functions
                - Service Plans
                    - Consumption Service - Azure Serverless Application
                    - Azure App Service - run function on VM
                - Storage Account - function must be linked to one
        c. Run Your Code On-Demand
            - Triggers
                - Blob Storage, Azure CosmosDB, Event Grid, HTTP, Microsoft Graph Events, Queue Storage, Service Bus, Timer
            - Bindings - connect data and services declaratively
                - read data from input bindings and write data to output bindings
            - Quickstart Templates
            - Testing - Manual or Within Portal
            - View Files - function.json and index.js
