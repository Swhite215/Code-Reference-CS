Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate

Manage Resources

    1. Module 1: Align Requirements with Cloud Types and Service Models
        a. Azure Solutions for Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud
            - Cloud Computing - provisioning of service and applications on demand over the internet
            - Public Cloud
                - Services are offered over the public internet and availble to anyone who wants to purchase them
                - Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider
                - Why? - Service consumption is on-demand, no upfront hardware, automation, geographic dispersity, reduced hardware maintenance
            - Private Cloud
                - Computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization
                - Located at organization's data center or hosted by a third-party service provider
                - Why? - Pre-existing environment, legacy applications, data sovereignty and security, regulatory compliance
            - Hybrid Cloud
                - Combines public and private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them
                - Why? - Existing hardware investment, regulatory requirements, unique operating environments, migration
        b. Cloud Service Models
            - Infrastructure-as-a-Service IaaS - provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and manage over the internet
            - Platform-as-a-Serice PaaS - provides ready-made development and deployment environments taht you can use to deliver your own cloud service
            - Software-as-a-Service SaaS - delivers applications over the internet as a web based service
            - Spectrum
                - You Manage - On-Premises, IaaS, PaaS, Provider Managers - SaaS
        c. Infrastructure-as-a-Service
            - Common Scenarios - Website Hosting, Web Apps, Storage/Backup/Recovery, High-Performance Computing, Big Data Analysis
            - Advantages - Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing costs, improves business continuity, respond quicker to shifting conditions, increase stability, reliability, and supportability
        d. Platform-as-a-Service
            - Common Scenarios - Development framework, analytics or business intelligence
            - Advantages - Reduced development time, develop for multiple platforms, affordable sophisticated tools, support geographically distributed development teams, efficiently manage application lifecycle
        d. Software-as-a-Service
            - Common Scenarios - Productivity apps such as email, collaboration, calendaring, and sophisticated business applications
            - Advantages - Access to sophisticated applications, use free client software, access app data from anywhere

    2. Module 2: Control Azure Services with the CLI
        a. What is the Azure CLI?
            - Command-line program to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources
        b. Exercise - Install
            - brew update && brew install azure-cli && az --version
        c. Work with the Azure CLI
            - What resources? - resource groups, storage, virtual machines, azure active directory, containers, machine learning and more
            - Group - service provided by Azure
            - Subgroup - divide commands for service into logical groupings
            - Example - storage = group, and account, blob, storage, and queue = subgroups
            - Tips and Tricks
                - az find subgroup/group, az find "az group", az find "az group command"
                - az group subgroup --help
                - az group list --query "[?name == '$RESOURCE_GROUP']"
                - az appservice plan create --help
            - Creating a resource
                - Connect - az login
                - Create - az group create --name <name> --location <location>
                - Verify - az group list & az group list --output table
        d. Exercise - Create an Azure Website Using the CLI
            - Variables
                - export RESOURCE_GROUP=learn-d53fd2e7-4def-4e95-8eb7-e10be0d1dd85
                - export AZURE_REGION=centralus
                - export AZURE_APP_PLAN=popupappplan-$RANDOM
                - export AZURE_WEB_APP=popupwebapp-$RANDOM
            - az group list --output table
            - Create App Service
                - az appservice plan create --name $AZURE_APP_PLAN --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $AZURE_REGION --sku FREE
                - az appservice plan list --output table
            - Create WebApp
                - az webapp create --name $AZURE_WEB_APP --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --plan $AZURE_APP_PLAN
                - az webapp list --output table
            - Deploy Code from Github
                - az webapp deployment source config --name $AZURE_WEB_APP --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --repo-url "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world" --branch master --manual-integration
                - curl $AZURE_WEB_APP.azurewebsites.net
