Fundamentals of Microsoft Azure

    1. Module 1: Cloud Concepts - Principles of Cloud Computing
        a. What is cloud computing?
            - Pay for what you use, rental of computing resources on another company's computers
            - Resources - compute power, storage, networking, analytics
            - Compute Power
                - Virtual Machines, Containers and Serverless Computing
        b. Benefits of Cloud Computing
            - Cost-Effective, Scalable, Elastic, Current, Reliable, Global, Secure
        c. Compliance Terms and Requirements
            - Criminal Justice Information Services
            - Cloud Security Alliance STAR Certification
            - General Data Protection Regulation
            - EU Model Clauses
            - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
            - International Organization for Standardization
            - International Electrotechnical Commission
            - Multi-Tier Cloud Security
            - Service Organization Controls
            - National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework
            - UK Government G-Cloud
        d. Economies of Scale
            - Abilitry to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale
        e. Capital Expenditure CapEx vs. Operational Expenditure OpEx
            - Capital Expenditure - spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that 
            expense from your tax bill over time. Upfront cost with a value that reduces over time.
            - Operating Expenditure - spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You
            can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year.
            - CapEx Costs - Server, Storage, Network, Backup and Archive, Continuity, Disaster Recovery, Infrastructure, Personnel
            - OpEx Costs - Software and Features, Scaling based on Demand, User/Org Billing
        f. Cloud Deployment Models
            - Defines - where your data is stored and how customers interact with it
            - Public - all cloud resources are owned and managed by cloud provider, access delievered over internet
                - Advantages - Scalability, Agility, Pay as You Go, Responsibility, Minimumn Knowledge
                - Disadvantages - unment security, legal, policy, business requirements 
            - Private - computing resource used by one organization, on-premise or cloud
                - Advantages - Configuration, Security, and Policy Control
                - Disadvantages - CapEx, Limited Agility, Requires IT Skills
            - Hybrid - some applications and data on private infrastructure and some on cloud
                - Advantages - Version Control, Flexibility, Economies of Scale, Use Own Equipemnt
                - Disadvantages - Expensive, Complicated
        g. Cloud Services
            - Infrastructure as a Service IaaS - server in the cloud you have complete control over
            - Platform as a Service SaaS - support complete application lifecycle
            - Software as a Service PaaS - web based alternate software that is frequently subscription based
                - Office 365, and Skype
