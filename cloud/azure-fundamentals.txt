    11. Module 11: Azure Resource Manager
        a. Principles of Resource Groups
            - Resource Groups - logical container for resources deployed on Azure, one resource group per resource
            - Lifecycle - if you delete a resource group, all resources within are also deleted
            - Resource Groups are a scope for Role-Based Access Control
            - Create a Resource Group
                - Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Templates, Azure SDKs

                - Life Cycle - Easy Tear Down
                - Billing -  Grouped into Billing Reports
        b. Use Tagging to Organize Resources
            - Tags - name/value pairs of text data that can apply to resources or resource groups
            - 50 Tags, each name is 512 characters long except for 128 character storage accounts, tag value is limited to 256 characters
            - Azure Policy can be used to automatically add or enforce tags for resources

        c. Use Policies to Enforce Standards
            - Create New Policy -> Assignments -> Assign Policy -> Create Assignment
            - Create a resource within subscription and confirm the policy works
        d. Secure Resources with Role-Based Access Control
            - Give Role -> RBAC allows specific actions such as read, write, or delete
            - Best Practices - Segregate Duties, Use Lowest Level Privilege Needed, Use Resource Locks
        e. Use Resource Locks to Protect Resources
            - Resource Locks - setting that can be applied to any resource to block modification or deletion
            - Create a Resource Lock -> Name and Lock Type
