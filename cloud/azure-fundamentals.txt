        e. Capital Expenditure CapEx vs. Operational Expenditure OpEx
            - Capital Expenditure - spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that 
            expense from your tax bill over time. Upfront cost with a value that reduces over time.
            - Operating Expenditure - spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You
            can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year.
            - CapEx Costs - Server, Storage, Network, Backup and Archive, Continuity, Disaster Recovery, Infrastructure, Personnel
            - OpEx Costs - Software and Features, Scaling based on Demand, User/Org Billing
