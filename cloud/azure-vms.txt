    1. Module 1: Introduction to Azure Virtual Machines
        a. Compile a Checklist for Creating an Azure Virtual Machine
            - IaaS
                - Maintain: Operating Systems, Patches, Peformances, Disk Usage
                - Virtual Network Interface
            - Network
                - VMs and Services on the same virtual network can access one another
                - You can configure the network to allow access to the external service
                - Setup - Address Spaces, Subnets, and Security
                - Subnets - 10.1.0.0 to VMs, 10.2.0.0. to BE, 10.3.0.0 to SQL Server VMs
                - Security - Network Security Groups e.g. software firewalls
            - Plan
                - What does the server communicate with?
                - Which ports are open?
                - Which OS is used?
                - How much disk space is in use?
                - What kind of data does this VM use? Are their restrictions?
                - What sort of CPU, memory, and disk I/O load does the server have? Is there burst traffic to account for?
            - VM Name
                - [environment][location][instnace][product][role]
                - Azure Resource - VM, storage account for the disks, virtual network, network interface, network security group, public internet address
            - VM Location
            - VM Size - General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, GPU, High Performance Compute
            - Price Model
                - Compute Costs - priced per-hour, billed on a per-minute basis
                - Storage Costs - pay-as-you-go, and reserved virtual machine instances
            - VM Storage
                - Two Virtual Hard Disks VHD - 1 for Operating System amd 1 for Temporary Storage
                - Azure Storage - MS cloud-based data storage solution
                - Virtual Disks - standard or premium storage accounts
                - Disks - managed or unmanaged
            - VM Operating System
        b. Create a VM using Azure Portal
            - Azure Portal -> Create a Resource -> Ubuntu -> Configure
        c. Options to Create and Manage a Virtual Machine
            - Azure Resource Manager - JSON templates
            - Azure PowerShell - one-off interactives and/or the automation of repeated tasks
            - Azure CLI
            - Azure REST API
            - Azure Client SDK
            - Azure VM Extensions - configure and automate tasks on VMs after initial deployment
            - Azure Automation Services - process automation, configuration management, and update management
        d. Manage the Availability of your VMs
            - Availability - percentage of time a service is available for use
            - Availability Set - logical feature used to ensure that a group of VMs are deployed so that they aren't sibject to a single point of failure
            - Fault Domain - logical group of hardware that shares a common power source and network switch
            - Update Domain - logical group of hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time
            - Failover Across Locations
                - Azure Site Recovery - replicates workloads from a primary site to a secondary location
        e. Back Up Virtual Machines
            - Azure Backup - backup as a service offering
            - Advantages of Azure Backup
                - Automatic Storage Management
                - Unlimited Scaling
                - Multiple Storage Options
                - Unlimited Data Transfer
                - Data Encryption
                - Application-Consistent Backup
                - Long Term Retention
