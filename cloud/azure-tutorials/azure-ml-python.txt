Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate

Introduction to Machine Learning with Python and Azure Notebooks

    1. Module 1: Analyze Climate Data with Azure Notebooks
        a. Exercise - Create an Azure Notebook
            - https://notebooks.azure.com/
            - My Projects -> +New Project -> Configure -> +Notebook -> Configure -> Open Notebook
        b. Exercise - Upload Data and Create Scatterplot
            - Cells - markdown, code (interactive), raw NBConvert (inline data)
            - Kernel executes code in cells
        c. Exercise - Perform Linear Regression with Numpy
        d. Exercise - Perform Linear Regression with Scikit Learn
        e. Exercise - Analyze Data with Seaborn
        f. Exercise - Share a Notebook
            - Notebook -> File: Close and Halt -> Project Settings -> Check Public Project -> Share
    
    2. Module 2: Predict Flight Delays by Creating a ML Model in Python
        a.  Exercise - Create an Azure Notebook and Import Data
            - My Projects -> +New Project -> Configure -> +Notebook -> Configure -> Open Notebook
        b. Exercise - Clean and Prepare Data
            - DataFrame Information
                - df.shape - (rows, columns)
                - df.isnull().values.any() - True or False
                - df.isnull().sum() - number of cells in each column
                - df = df[[<COLUMN>, <COLUMN>]]
                - df.head() - first five rows of DataFrame
        c. Exercise - Build Machine Learning Model
        d. Exercise - Visualize Output of Model

    3. Module 3: Analyze the Sentiment of Reviews with Keras
        a. Introduction
            - Keras - open-source Python library that dramatically simplifies the building of neural networks
        b. Exercise - Create an Azure Notebook
            - My Projects -> +New Project -> Configure -> +Notebook -> Configure -> Open Notebook
        c. Exercise - Build and Train a Neural Network
        d. Exercise - Use the Neural Network to Analyze Text for Sentiment
