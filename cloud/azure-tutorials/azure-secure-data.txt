    3. Module 3: Configure Security Policies to Manage Data
        a. Classify Your Data at Rest, in Process, and in Transit
            - States - rest, process, transit
            - Classiifcation - confidential, non-confidential
            - Structured or Unstructured
            - Protect at Rest
                - Azure Disk Encryption

                - SSL/TLS Protocols
                - HTTPS or VPN (Azure VPN Gateway)
            - Data Discovery
                - Advanced Data Security - package for advanced MSSQL Server security capabilities
                - Process - Discovery, Labeling, Query Result Set Sensitivity, Visibility
        b. Exercise - Classify an Azure SQL Database
            - Create Database
                - Create a Resource -> Database -> SQL Database -> Configure
            - SQL Information Protection
                - SQL IP - Discoevring, Labeling, Monitoring, Visibility
            - Classify your SQL DB
                - Database -> Security: Advanced Threat Protection -> Data Discovery and Classification -> (i) -> All Columns -> Accept
                - Overview -> Classification -> Add Classification
            - Monitor Access to Sensitive Data
                - Azure SQL Database Auditing
        c. Explore Data Recovery, Retention, and Disposal

        d. Understand Data Sovereignty
            - Data is subject to the laws of the country or region where it is stored
            - Geography - area of the world that contains at least one Azure Region
            - Azure Region - are containing one or more data centers
            - Paired Region - region paired within another region in the same geogrpahy
                - Azure Compute - must provision additional compute resources in advance
                - Azure Storage - Geo-redundant storage is configured by default

            - Benefits of Paired Regions
                - Physical Isolation - reduces the likelihood of both regions being affected simultaneuosly as a result of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages
                - Platform Provided Replication - geo-redundant storage provides automatic replication
                - Region Recovery Order - recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair
                - Sequential Updates - updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially
                - Data Residency - region resides within same geography as pair for tax and law enforcement purposes
