    3. Module 3: Configure Security Policies to Manage Data
        a. Classify Your Data at Rest, in Process, and in Transit
            - States - rest, process, transit
            - Classiifcation - confidential, non-confidential
            - Structured or Unstructured
            - Protect at Rest

                - Process - Discovery, Labeling, Query Result Set Sensitivity, Visibility
        b. Exercise - Classify an Azure SQL Database
            - Create Database
                - Create a Resource -> Database -> SQL Database -> Configure
            - SQL Information Protection
                - SQL IP - Discoevring, Labeling, Monitoring, Visibility
            - Classify your SQL DB
                - Database -> Security: Advanced Threat Protection -> Data Discovery and Classification -> (i) -> All Columns -> Accept
                - Overview -> Classification -> Add Classification
            - Monitor Access to Sensitive Data

        d. Understand Data Sovereignty
            - Data is subject to the laws of the country or region where it is stored
            - Geography - area of the world that contains at least one Azure Region
            - Azure Region - are containing one or more data centers
            - Paired Region - region paired within another region in the same geogrpahy
                - Azure Compute - must provision additional compute resources in advance

            - Benefits of Paired Regions
                - Physical Isolation - reduces the likelihood of both regions being affected simultaneuosly as a result of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages
                - Platform Provided Replication - geo-redundant storage provides automatic replication
                - Region Recovery Order - recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair
                - Sequential Updates - updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially
                - Data Residency - region resides within same geography as pair for tax and law enforcement purposes
    
    4. Module 4: Configure and Manage Secrets in Azure Key Vault
        a. Guidelines for Using Azure Key Vault (Server Side)
            - Key Vault - centralized cloud service for storing application secrets such as encryption keys, certificates, and server-side tokens
            - Vaults - a secure container
                - Create a New Vault: 
                    - az keyvault create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <your-unique-vault-name>
                    - New-AzKeyVault -Name <your-unique-vault-name> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>
            - Keys - cryptographic asset destined for a particular use e.g. asymmetric master key of Microsoft Azure RMS
                - Applications must use keys by calling cryptography methods on the Key Vault service, never has direct access to the keys
                - Single instanced - only one key exists
                - Versioned - key is an object with a primary key and a collection of one or more secondary keys
                - Hardware Protected Keys - Hardware Software Module - cryptographic operations are performed within the HSM
                - Software Protected Keys - RSA and ECC algorithms - cryptographic operations are performed in the software
            - Secrets - data blobs protected by a HSM generate key created with the Key Vault
                - Used for sensistive settings like storage account keys, .PFX files, SQL connection strings, data encryption keys, passsowrds, API keys, etc.
            - Key Vault Uses
                - Secrets, Key, and Certificate Management
            - Best Practices
                - Use RBAC in Management Plane and Data Plane
                - Store Certificates in Key Vault
                - Enable Soft Delete and Purge Protection Features
        b. Manage Access to Secrets, Certificates, and Keys
            - Authentication - Azure actrive Directory
            - Authorization - RBAC
                - Key Vault Contributor - access to management but not key vault data
                - Contributor - full administration rights
                - Key Vault Access Policy - permission set assigned to a user or managed identity to read, write, and/or delete secrets and keys
            - Restricting Network Access
                - Virtual Network Subnets, IP Addresses, and trusted MS Services
        c. Exercise - Store Secrets in Azure Key Vault]
            - Create a Azure Key Vault
                - Create a Resource -> Key Vault -> Configure
            - Add a Secret
                - Azure Key Vault -> Settings: Secrets -> Generate/Import -> Create a Secret
            - Show the Secret
                - Azure Key Vault -> Settings: Secrets -> Secret -> Show Secret Value
            - Other Ways to Consume Secret
                - Powershell
                    - Get Key Vault: Get-AzureRmKeyVault
                    - Get Secret: (Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -vaultName <vault-name> -name <secret-name>).SecretValueText
        d. Manage Certificates
            - Add Certificates to a Key Vault
                - Create Self-Signed Certificate - Portal
                - Create Certificate Signing Request -> Pass to Certificate Authority
                    - Create Cert Key and Put in Key Vault -> Generate CSR -> Pass CSR to CA -> Receive x509 Certificate -> Merge x509 with Key
                - Integrated CA
                    - Create Certificate and Put in Key Vault -> Key Vault Makes SSQL Certificate Request to CA -> CA Returns xz509 Certificate -> Merge x509 with Key
                - Import Certificates .PFX or .PEM
            - Retrieve Certificates
                - Key Vault -> Certificates -> Certificate -> Enable/Disable
                - App Service -> Settings: TLS/SSL -> Private Key Certificate -> Import Key Vault Certificate -> Vault and Secret -> Setup Custom Domain
