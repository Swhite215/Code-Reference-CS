    3. Module 3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysius with Azure Databricks
        a. Introduciton
            - Exploratory Data Analysis EDA - process of analyzing datasets to find anomalies and missing information
            - Questions to Answer:
                - What type of data is in the dataset and what is its structure?
                - Is there missing or incomplete information?
                - Are there mistakes or anomalies?
                - What are the relationships between different variables?
                - How will different assumptions work against the available dataset?
        b. Exploratory Data Analysis in Azure Databricks
            - Basic EDA - data cleaninsing, handling of missing values, and correlation analysis
                - Import -> Load into Spark DataFrames
