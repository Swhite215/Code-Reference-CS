Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate

Store Data in Azure

    1. Module 1: Choose a Data Storage Approach in Azure
        a. Classify Data
            - Structured - relational data, strict schema
            - Semi-Structured - tags such as key/value pairs, NoSQL
                - Serialization Languages - XML, JSON, YAML
                - NoSQL - key-value, graph, document
            - Unstructured
                - files, photos, videos
        b. Determine Operational Needs
            - Operations and Latency
                - Will you be doing lookups using an ID?
                - Do you need to query the database for one or more fields?
                - How many create, update, and delete operations do you expect?
                - Do you need to run complex analytical queries?
                - How quickly do these operations need to complete?
        c. Group Multiple Operations in a Transaction
            - Transaction - logical group of database operations that execute together
            - ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
            - OLTP vs. OLAP - Online Transaction Processing (large volume of data), Online Analytical Processing (large complexity)
    
    2. Module 2: Create an Azure Storage Account
        a.  Decide How Many Storage Accounts You Need
            - Azure Storage - Azure Blogs, Azure Files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables (Primitive and Cloud-Based)
            - Storage Account - container that groups a set of Azure Storage services together
                - Subscription - Azure subscription that will be billed for the services in the account
                - Location - Datacenter that will store the services in the account
                - Performance - Standard -  Blob, File, Queue, Table or Premium - Page Blob and SSDs
                - Replication - strategy used to make copies of your data (Locally Redundant Storage)
                - Access Tier - Blob access speed is either hot = quick or cool = slower
                - Secure Transfer Required - HTTPs vs. HTTP
                - Virtual Networks - security feature that allows inbound access requests
            - How Many? - One for every group of settings that you want to apply for your data 
                - Data Diversity - e.g. specific to a region or proprietary 
                - Cost Sensitivity - e.g. critical w/ geo-redundant storage and non-critical w/ locally-redundant storage
                - Tolerance for MGMT Overhead - e.g. partitions that share characteristics like location, billing and replication, then storage account for each
        b. Choose Your Account Settings
            - Name - globally unique, lowercase and digits, between 3 and 24 characters
            - Deployment Model - Resource Manager w/ Azure Resource Manager API (Recommended) or Classic w/ Azure Service Management API
            - Account Kind - StorageV2 supports all storage types and features, Storage supports all storage types, Blob supports block blobs and append blobs
        c. Choose Account Creation Tool
            - Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Management Client Libraries
        d. Exercise - Create a Storage Account
    
    3. Module 3: Connect an App to Azure Storage

            - Protecting Shared Keys
                - Regenerate Periodically If - hacked, member leavesm etc.
        c. Understand Access Signatures

            - Types of SAS
                - Service Level - allow access to specific resources in a storage account e.g. allow an app to retrieve a list of files
                - Account-Level - allow access to anything that a service-level shared access signature can allow e.g. ability to create file systems
            - Typical Designs w// User Read and Write Data
                - Clients upload and download data through a front-end proxy service, which performs authentication
                - Lightweight service authenticates client as needed, then generates a SAS for client, then client uses SAS
