Store Data in Azure

    1. Module 1: Choose a Data Storage Approach in Azure
        a. Classify Data
            - Structured - relational data, strict schema
            - Semi-Structured - tags such as key/value pairs, NoSQL
                - Serialization Languages - XML, JSON, YAML
                - NoSQL - key-value, graph, document
            - Unstructured
                - files, photos, videos
        b. Determine Operational Needs
            - Operations and Latency
                - Will you be doing lookups using an ID?
                - Do you need to query the database for one or more fields?
                - How many create, update, and delete operations do you expect?
                - Do you need to run complex analytical queries?
                - How quickly do these operations need to complete?
        c. Group Multiple Operations in a Transaction
            - Transaction - logical group of database operations that execute together
            - ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
            - OLTP vs. OLAP - Online Transaction Processing (large volume of data), Online Analytical Processing (large complexity)
